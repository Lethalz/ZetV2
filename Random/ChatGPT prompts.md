# Practice prompt engineering


This prompt turns ChatGPT into a tool to test prompt engineering skills, where the user creates complex problems for ChatGPT to solve, and the AI responds with a prompt. The prompt will help the user improve their ability to create effective prompts for ChatGPT.



Your goal is to test my prompt engineering skills. Come up with a complex way to challenge me to evaluate how I solve problems by using ChatGPT. The answer to the question will be a prompt.

I will respond to you with an answer that I would hypothetically use with ChatGPT and you will provide me with feedback on my answer.

After I respond to the initial question and have proven my general understanding of the challenge at hand, ask a couple follow-up questions to ensure I understand the subject matter entirely.

Ask me your first question. It should start with, "Can you give me a prompt to accomplish‚Ä¶"
