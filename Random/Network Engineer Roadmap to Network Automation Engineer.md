[[STUDY PLAN 4 NETWORKING]]

Summary:

Get good at at the networking forundamentals but understand that the future is cloud and automation but having a really strong foundation in networking is huge be a purple cow.


## Get into the field - Certifications

A+ - Finished

CCNA - (In Progress)

Security+ - For DOD certification, and NetSec Understanding (Not Sure As of now)
Quick and dirty.

Linux+ - go through and learn the fundamentals take your time.

Cisco DevNet Associate - before CCNP Automation is huge
	At this point should have bought those Udemy courses to dip my toes in Network automation.

AZ-900 

CCNP - (After doing multiple projects (listed below) and getting alot of experience)
[[CCNP Study materials]]



RHCE/RHCSA - By this time you'll know where to put this my boy

 [VMware Certified Professional - Network Virtualization 2023](https://www.vmware.com/learning/certification/vcp-nv-nsxt.html)

	- Need CCNA to get around classroom requirement, which will then qualify you for other VCP-level certifications without further classroom training required.

## Books To Read

Computer Networking : A Top-Down Approach

DNS and BIND : DNS is a big part of networking, even if it isn't nessaceraily networking.

TCP/IP illustrated Volume 1

Computer networking by tanabaum 

Network Warrior - After CCNA to fill in some gaps


**These books are theory in order for us to learn we need to put in the hands-on practice**

## Programming Language
<<<<<<< HEAD
Bash then Powershell
Python 
Anisble



**Learn How to Write Reusable Code**

# Lateral Tech

Project Management - Having project management skills would be useful as a networking professional. You could learn about topics such as project planning, risk management, budgeting, and stakeholder management.

Linux: Learning about Linux would be helpful as it is a widely used operating system in the world of networking. You could learn about topics such as Linux commands, file systems, networking, and administration.

Cloud Computing: As more and more organizations are moving their infrastructure to the cloud, it would be beneficial to learn about cloud computing. You could learn about cloud architecture, virtualization, cloud deployment models, cloud security, and more.

Cybersecurity: Since networking and cybersecurity are closely related, learning about cybersecurity would be a great way to expand your knowledge. You could learn about topics such as network security, vulnerability assessment, penetration testing, encryption, and more.

## Machine Learning

This is going to be huge in the industry when it comes to networking. learn how and why this works and use it to your advantage, especially since gpt-4 is coming out fairly soon.

1.  "AI for Network Engineers" course on Udemy: This course provides an introduction to AI for network engineers and covers topics like machine learning, deep learning, and neural networks.
    
2.  "AI in Networking" book by Ajit Jaokar: This book provides a comprehensive overview of AI in networking and covers topics like network security, optimization, and management.
    
3.  "Artificial Intelligence for Network Optimization" paper by Xiaoliang Wang et al.: This paper provides a detailed overview of AI-based network optimization techniques and algorithms.
    
4.  "AI in Network Security" course on Coursera: This course provides an introduction to AI-based network security solutions like firewalls and intrusion detection systems.
    
5.  "Practical AI for the Network Engineer" video series by NetworkChuck: This video series provides a practical introduction to AI for network engineers and covers topics like machine learning, natural language processing, and computer vision.

## Cloud

Get a Entry level Cloud certifcation and understand networking in the cloud

AZ-900 -> AZ-104 -> AZ-700

Master Cloud networking 

Also learn to automate natworking in the cloud

## Network monitoring

Nagios, Zabbix, and PRTG


## Version Control

Learn Git Throughout
Put things you are working on up there
If you can't put the actual project put **well-defined documentation.**


## Automation

[Python for Network Engineers](https://www.udemy.com/course/master-python-network-automation-for-network-engineers/)
Automation is going to be huge for me. 

Before Python learning some BASH and Linux administration is key, most networkign in the world is done with linux/UNIX systems.

Start learning about network automation tools, such as **Ansible, Chef, Puppet, Terraform, and Nornir**

## DevOps

CI/CD 

Learn to integrate with devops 
Allows an organization to work as a unit 
and Networking is included in all of that

Your doing netowkring to get into the field and build on those fundamentals.
## Other Technologies
SD-WAN
CISCO ISE
