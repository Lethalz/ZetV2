Summary:

Get good at at the networking forundamentals but understand that the future is cloud and automation but having a really strong foundation in networking is huge be a purple cow.


## Get into the field - Certifications

A+ - Finished

CCNA - (In Progress)

Security+ - For DOD certification, and NetSec Understanding (Not Sure As of now)
Quick and dirty.

Linux+ - go through and learn the fundamentals take your time.

Cisco DevNet Associate - before CCNP Automation is huge
	At this point should have bought those Udemy courses to dip my toes in Network automation.

AZ-900 

CCNP - (After doing multiple projects (listed below) and getting alot of experience)

RHCE/RHCSA - By this time you'll know where to put this my boy

 [VMware Certified Professional - Network Virtualization 2023](https://www.vmware.com/learning/certification/vcp-nv-nsxt.html)

	- Need CCNA to get around classroom requirement, which will then qualify you for other VCP-level certifications without further classroom training required.

## Books To Read

Computer Networking : A Top-Down Approach

DNS and BIND : DNS is a big part of networking, even if it isn't nessaceraily networking.

TCP/IP illustrated Volume 1

Computer networking by tanabaum 

Network Warrior - After CCNA to fill in some gaps


**These books are theory in order for us to learn we need to put in the hands-on practice**

## Cloud

Get a Entry level Cloud certifcation and understand networking in the cloud

AZ-900 -> AZ-104 -> AZ-700

Master Cloud networking 

Also learn to automate natworking in the cloud



## Version Control

Learn Git Throughout
Put things you are working on up there
If you can't put the actual project put **well-defined documentation.**


## Automation

[Python for Network Engineers](https://www.udemy.com/course/master-python-network-automation-for-network-engineers/)
Automation is going to be huge for me. 

Before Python learning some BASH and Linux administration is key, most networkign in the world is done with linux/UNIX systems.

Start learning about network automation tools, such as **Ansible, Terraform, and Nornir**

## DevOps

CI/CD 

Learn to integrate with devops 
Allows an organization to work as a unit 
and Networking is included in all of that

Your doing netowkring to get into the field and build on those fundamentals.
## Other Technologies
SD-WAN
CISCO ISE
