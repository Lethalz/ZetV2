# Practicing with a metronome


1. Slow Practice is the key to fast playing:

- Slow down difficult passages while keeping the pace consistent
- identify the *shortest* note value and set your metronome to 60 so that it recieves one beat
- Increase the metronome by 5 clicks and repeat after you feel good enough

2. Make it SWING: Use **_dotted rhythms_** to help improve your timing:

- Dotted just means the notes aren't uniform you aren't only playing on whole or half beats but inbetween

- Identify the shortest note in the passage then set your metronome to 72 bpm and alternate between giving notes three beats and one beat.

- move your metronome up five clicks and repeat the process.

	When you have pushed your metronome to its max bpm, you can re-set your metronome back to 60 bpm, and again play through the passage with the same rhythmic feel, however, this time you will alternate between giving each note one and a half beats, and half of a beat.  For example, the first note will receive 1.5 beats (play one the downbeat of “1”) and the second note will receive .5 beats (play on the “and” of the second beat). The third note will receive 1.5 beats (played on the downbeat of “3”) and the fourth note will receive .5 beats (played on the “and” of the fourth beat).
	Again, after you can play through the whole passage this way without any mistakes, move your metronome up five clicks and repeat the process.

3.  Reverse your DOTTED rhythms:

- The idea here is that you will practice a long passage by alternating between short notes and long notes. The difference here is that every note that received **THREE** beats before will now receive only **ONE** beat, and every note that previously received **ONE** beat will now receive **THREE** beats.

	4. **_Phasing your phrasing:_** Begin by setting your metronome to 40 bpm. Play through the passage slowly at 40 bpm without making any mistakes. When you feel comfortable with the passage at this speed, we will use a technique called **_phasing_** to shift the timing of the notes in the passage as you practice them.
	When you can comfortably play through the passage at 40 bpm beginning on the downbeat, begin the passage again, however, this time start the **_FIRST_** note of the passage **_one sixteenth note later_** than written in the score. That means that you will now practice the entire passage starting on the “e” of beat one (**ex.** 1 – **_e_** – & – a – 2 – e – & – a – etc…). When you can comfortably play through the passage this way begin again, but this time shift the first note of the passage **_two sixteenth notes_**  later than written in the score. That means that you will now practice the entire passage starting on the “&” of beat one (**ex.** 1 – e- **&** – a – etc…). Finally, when you can comfortably play through the passage this way begin once more, but this time shift the first note of the passage **_three sixteenth notes later_** than written in the score. That means that you will now practice the entire passage starting on the “a” of beat one (**ex.** 1 – e – & – **a** – etc…).
