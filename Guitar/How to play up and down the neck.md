# How to play up and down the neck

1 Learn all the notes on the neck
2 Learn major and minor scales 
3 all caged chord shapes have a scale that corresponds 
4 improvise


Chords are derived from scales, so knowing where the chords are makes it easier to 'see' where the scales are. When you're soloing you're usually targeting chords tones anyway, they're the notes that 'sound better' and give resolution to the listener.
