**For everything you are struggling with** SLOW IT DOWN no need to rush to play everything slow it down and practice with a metronome. To learn anything you want to break it down to granular levels

**Learn to switch chords smoothly**, this takes practice but it will help. Go from A to D to E to A to E to D for example over and over, until it sounds good and you can do it blind.

**Air changes** Practice forming the chords in the air before you touch the frets

**Strumming is important** get used to using the wrist to strum

Flatpicking , practice hitting each string or isolate the top three and bottom three strings .. just get really good at isolating them

Learn the notes on the top two strings
They are the root for a lot of chords you will play

Learn the Major and minor scales, first in a four fret space and then all the way down the neck. In doing this you will be able to play in key much easier because the major scales essentially is a key (I know that it a little more complicated than that but for beginners it a good step). Many people will say learn the blues scales (or other scale) first but for the most part these scales are part of the over all major scale. The reason why your frets are where they are on the neck is because of the major scale, the guitar (and other instruments) are made for the major scale. (I might explain this in more detail later if this post get a good response) For example Metallica plays in the E minor scale a lot, some of there songs use it almost exclusively, from riff, chorus, bridge to solo.

-learn all the chord shapes. Especially the ones in first position. Learn to move between them fluidly and easily. 


-learn simple songs. Play them every time you practice until they sound nice and clean


-practice in a musical fashion. Don’t just play boring scales over and over. Make them sound musical. Mess with the timing and phrasing.


-focus on **rhythm guitar** at first. 90% of what you do on guitar is rhythm. Learn to solo later.

-play either with other people, or with jam tracks. Get good at playing not just by yourself, but with others.

# Learning the fretboard
To learn the fretboard notes, the common answer is not the one that worked for me by itself. I've used this following method myself and I've taught others successfully this way, so try it. It took me one week to know the fretboard. You learn notes and arpeggios at once. Most importantly, you learn the notes in relation to other notes.

Take your Am key (it is the same as C key, but from A note) ABCDEFG.

Harmonized in order, it is: Am (ACE), B° (BDF), C (CEG), Dm (DFA), Em (EGB), F (FAC), G (GBD).

If you arrange it in this following order, you can easily see that all chords are just degrees of each other: ACE, CEG, EGB, GBD, BDF, DFA, FAC, (and back to ACE).

Exercise: Start on 6th string, build each 3 note arpeggio in 3 ascending patterns, WHILE SAYING/SINGING EACH NOTE.

The following is written in string/fret format, where s6f5 = string 6 (low E) fret 5 (note A). (Note that a fret 12 frets higher is the same note, just a an octave higher: s6f17, note A). I'll start you off;

Minors:

Am (ACE) = s6f5, s6f8, s5f7. Then s6f5, s5f3, s5f7. Then s6f5, s5f3, s4f2, a playable triad. Note that Dm (DFA) and Em (EGB) will be the exact same patterns, just starting on D and E, respectively.

Majors:

C (CEG) = s6f8, s6f12, s5f10. Then s6f8, s5f7, s5f10. Then s6f8, s5f7, s4f5, a playable triad. Note that F (FAC) and (G (GBD) will be the exact same patterns, just starting on F and G, respectively.

Diminished:

B° (BDF) = s6f7, s6f10, s5f8. Then s6f7, s5f5, s5f8. Then s6f7, s5f5, s4f3, a playable triad.

Next, move to 5th string, repeat this, then 4th string, then 3rd, then the 2nd. Notice that the pattern changes once the B (second) string is involved when playing off of the 4th, and 3rd strings.

After a week, you'll know these notes, and the 5 sharp/flat notes will be obvious: you know D and E, so D#/Eb is between them.

Use this along with other recommendations and it will help you tremendously.

#### Exercise
Learn all the notes on the neck. Set your metronome to 60bpm and on the quarter note play A every where on the neck of the guitar starting with the 6th string and working your way up.

```
|------------------5----|
|---------------10------|
|-------------2---------|
|-----------7-----------|
|------0-12-------------|
|----5------------------|
```

I do this forwards and backwards just playing it over and over again. Then I find the 5th of my note A and do that. The 5th of A is E. So now I play E all over the neck.

Do that for two weeks to a month and you'll instantly know where every note is.

Once you have that then start working on chord triads. This is where you use 3 notes to make a chord shape. 1-3-5 is major and 1-b3-5 is minor. Start with A and do the same exercise.

The (root) is in parenthesis.

A Major

```
|------------------------------------------------------------------0-----(5)-----9------|
|--------------------------------------------2------5-----(10)-----2------5-----(10)----|
|------------------------(2)----6-----9-----(2)-----6------9------(2)-----6------9------|
|-----2----(7)----11------2----(7)----11-----2-----(7)-----11---------------------------|
|-----4-----7----(12)-----4-----7-----12------------------------------------------------|
|----(5)----9-----12--------------------------------------------------------------------|
```

A Minor

```
|------------------------------------------------------------------0-----(5)-----8------|
|--------------------------------------------1------5-----(10)-----1------5-----(10)----|
|------------------------(2)----5-----9-----(2)-----5------9------(2)-----5------9------|
|-----2----(7)----10------2----(7)----10-----2-----(7)-----10---------------------------|
|-----3-----7----(12)-----3-----7-----12------------------------------------------------|
|----(5)----8-----12--------------------------------------------------------------------|
```

If we (for some reason) start with A major and apply the same logic we did above then we could move through the A major scale and a standard chord structure.

1.  A major
    
2.  B minor
    
3.  C# minor
    
4.  D major
    
5.  E major
    
6.  F# minor
    
7.  G# minor
    

If we start on A and then go a 5th up we'd be at E major. If we keep doing this the pattern would be:

-   A major
    
-   E major
    
-   B minor
    
-   F# minor
    
-   C# minor
    
-   G# minor
    
-   D major
    
-   Done!!!
    

Spend a month reviewing these various triads and once you have them done try playing a song using chords in A major and try to group the chords in sections. Only play the chords from frets 1-5, then 6-11, then 12-15...however you can break it up.
