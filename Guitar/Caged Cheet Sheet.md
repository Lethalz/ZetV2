# CAGED System Cheat Sheet

## Overview
The CAGED System is an acronym representing the open chords C, A, G, E, and D. It's a method for visualizing familiar shapes in different hand positions across the fretboard. This approach aids in understanding the guitar's layout, facilitating easier improvisation and chord transitions.

## Key Points
- **Open and Closed Chords**: Illustrates major and minor variations.
- **Arpeggios**: Outlines major and minor patterns.
- **Scales**: Covers major and minor pentatonic scales, providing a foundation for soloing and melody construction.
- **Application**: Encourages viewing chord shapes (e.g., 'E Shape') as movable across the fretboard, not confined to the chord's original open position. This perspective allows for the playing of various chords and scales using familiar shapes.

## Strategy
- Approach the CAGED system as a 'Cut and Paste' technique. Learn a shape once and transfer it to various positions on the fretboard.
- Use this system to make new musical connections, enhancing both chord and scale play.
- Remember, the goal is to make guitar playing more intuitive and enjoyable by revealing the fretboard's mysteries.
