# Tom Quayle Interval visualization



![[Pasted image 20240208172136.png]]
All the nearby intervals over one octave, centred around a root note. This is movable anywhere on the fretboard in perfect 4th (P4) tuning. For standard guitar tuning the top row needs to be shifted one fret up (right) if the root is on the D string, and the top two rows need to be shifted one fret up if the root is on the G string. 


Interval names: 
m2 / m9: minor 2nd / 9th
M2 / M9: major 2nd / 9th 
m3: minor 3rd 
M3: major 3rd 
P4 / P11: perfect 4th / 11th
