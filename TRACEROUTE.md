# TRACEROUTE

# Traceroute

## My Understanding
[Space for your own notes and understanding of the topic]

## Fundamentals

Traceroute is a network diagnostic tool used to trace the path that packets take from a source device to a destination. It helps in identifying the route and measuring transit delays of packets across an IP network.

Key Concepts:
1. Purpose: Diagnose network congestion and routing issues
2. Functionality: Sends a sequence of packets to each router (hop) between source and destination
3. Protocols: Can use ICMP, UDP, or TCP packets
4. Windows uses ICMP echo request, Cisco/Linux uses UDP segments
5. TTL Manipulation: Uses Time-to-Live field in IP header to discover hops

How Traceroute Works:
1. Sends packets with incrementing TTL values (starting at 1)
2. Each hop decrements TTL
3. When TTL reaches zero, hop returns ICMP "Time Exceeded" message
4. Process continues until destination is reached or max hops are exceeded

Traceroute Output:
- Each line represents a hop
- Includes hop number, IP address of router, and Round-Trip Time (RTT) for packets
- Common symbols: "*" indicates packet loss or no response

Windows uses 'tracert' command (ICMP-based by default)
Linux/Unix uses 'traceroute' command (UDP-based by default)
Cisco IOS uses 'traceroute' command

## Feynman Method Explanation

Imagine you're sending a series of letters to a friend in another city, but you want to know every post office your letter passes through. You decide to use a clever trick:

1. You send the first letter with instructions "Only go to the next post office, then return to sender."
2. The second letter says "Go to two post offices, then return to sender."
3. You keep increasing the number for each letter.

Each time a letter "expires" at a post office, that office sends you back a note saying "Your letter expired here!" This way, you build a map of each post office (or "hop") along the route.

Traceroute does the same thing with data packets. It sends packets with increasing "Time to Live" (TTL) values. Each router decreases this TTL by 1. When it hits 0, the router sends back a message. By doing this repeatedly, Traceroute maps out the entire route to the destination.

## Relevant Commands

Windows Traceroute:
```
tracert destination
```

Linux/Unix Traceroute:
```
traceroute destination
```

Cisco IOS Traceroute:
```
traceroute destination
```

Cisco IOS Extended Traceroute:
```
traceroute
```

Specify number of probes per hop (Cisco IOS):
```
traceroute destination probe 5
```

Use specific source interface (Cisco IOS):
```
traceroute destination source interface
```

Use *numeric* to prevent the router from resolving the IP addresses to hostnames:
```
traceroute 0.0.0.0 numeric
```

Use the 'traceroute' command without arguments to enter extended traceroute mode, which offers more options.
```

Output codes you can receive in a traceroute:

## Limitations

- Depending on how devices in the path load-balance traffic, Traceroute could give inaccurate results.
- For example what if one of the hops (routers) is load-balancing the path

Traceroute may not always show the exact path packets take, as routes can change dynamically and some devices may be configured to not respond to traceroute probes.

## Conclusion

Traceroute is a powerful tool for network diagnostics and troubleshooting. By understanding how it works and how to interpret its output, network professionals can quickly identify routing issues, bottlenecks, and network topology. However, it's important to use traceroute in conjunction with other diagnostic tools for a comprehensive understanding of network behavior.
