# Epiphanies on learning

- Studying is not learning - Sitting down reading a book front to back or looking over notes is not how you learn. Studying is what leads to learning find youre way of studying and you can learn anything
    
- Vocabulary is Important - The best example I've been given was think about a car, when you think about a car you dont think about the wheels, the radiator, the engine, those expensive converters on the bottom. You think in terms of what it is, 'a car' and maybe you have some quick definition of what a car is to you. Do the same thing with IT, "whats RAM", Ram is quick non-permanent memory. So next time you think of ram instead of diving deep into the 'why' you find the 'what' and everything else comes along with it.
    
- High-level understanding - Never ask for someone elses notes, If Notes were the key to learning everyone would just take notes all day. Notes should not be word for word a slide that you just saw on a prof Messer video, otherwise youre just recreating the course at that point. Everything has a purpose so start there and build on that purpose to create a mind-map of how YOU understand the content.
