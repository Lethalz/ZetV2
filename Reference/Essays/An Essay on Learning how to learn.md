An Essay on Barbara Oakley’s “Learning How to Learn” Course

I recently completed Barbara Oakley’s “Learning How to Learn” course and was thoroughly impressed.  I’ve been on a reading spree lately, devouring books like Ultralearning, Learning Like a Pro, Moonwalking with Einstein, The Talent Code, and many others. This course effectively consolidates many of their core ideas into a cohesive learning experience suitable for everyone from high school students to college undergraduates to career professionals looking to enhance their independent study skills.

This essay will explore the key learning principles taught in this excellent course, focusing on how I intend to apply them to my networking studies and career.  I'll discuss techniques like spaced repetition, interleaving, and chunking—all of which I believe are essential for any network engineer, especially given the rapid pace of technological advancement and the constant need to acquire new knowledge quickly and efficiently.

Focused and Diffuse Thinking

We know of two primary modes of thinking: focused and diffuse.  As Barbara Oakley explains, the focused mode is what we engage when actively learning something new. We are deeply concentrated, and our brains are highly active.  The diffuse mode, on the other hand, occurs when we step away from active learning or study. We aren’t consciously thinking about the subject matter.

Both modes are crucial for effective learning. I can share a personal example: I was once working on a PDF project for a client that required automation, which necessitated using Javascript—a language I had never touched.  I searched for solutions, but after a couple of frustrating days, I felt close yet couldn't quite grasp the answer.  One night, I went to sleep, my mind occasionally drifting to the problem, though not directly focused on it.  The next morning, I woke up with a "eureka!" moment, having seemingly dreamt of the solution.

Our brains continue to work even when we aren't consciously aware.  Give your brain a goal you are passionate about, and it will find a way.  Learn to leverage the diffuse mode.  When you hit a wall in your understanding, take a break, perhaps even a nap.  Avoid actively trying to force a solution, as that will pull you back into the focused mode.

Oakley describes the brain as a pinball machine.  In the focused mode, the machine has many bumpers, making it difficult for your thoughts to navigate and form new connections.  In the diffuse mode, these bumpers dissipate, reducing friction and allowing thoughts to connect more freely.

While the diffuse mode is essential for generating new insights, the focused mode is vital for encoding them.  Just as you should relax after a focused study session, ensure you are deeply focused during study so that diffuse thinking can be most effective.

Interleaving

As a network engineer, I constantly juggle different protocols, technologies, and practices.  In my studies, I traditionally focused on one topic at a time, which is how we’re often taught in school: cram one subject to pass the test.

Oakley proposes a different approach: interleaving.  Unlike rote memorization, interleaving involves mixing different concepts or problem types during practice. Instead of memorizing a single approach, you explore multiple ways to solve the same problem or tackle different problems altogether. This creates a more varied learning experience, leading to greater flexibility in your knowledge. 

Like many of these learning strategies, interleaving might seem counterintuitive initially, but it leads to deeper and more meaningful understanding.  It's like baseball: if you only practice hitting fastballs, you'll be good at hitting fastballs, but what about curveballs or changeups? Interleaving prepares you for diverse scenarios and fosters adaptability. 

Instead of simply memorizing BGP and EtherChannel configurations, I will remind myself to vary my learning.  I will practice chaos engineering: after successfully configuring something, I'll intentionally break it.  This builds flexibility and understanding of potential issues, preparing me for real-world scenarios.

This approach will transform me from someone who merely follows instructions to a proactive problem-solver.

Spaced Repetition

Spaced repetition is a personal favorite.  Many people believe they struggle with learning or memorization, but this technique demonstrates that anyone can improve.  I believe that if we remembered everything, then nothing would be important.

As a network engineer, finding time for continuous learning can be challenging.  Spaced repetition allows for more efficient and deliberate use of study time.  We humans have a tendency to forget.  Scientists have discovered that forgetting follows a curve: memory decays rapidly at first, then levels off.  We can counteract this by reviewing material at increasing intervals, strengthening memory each time and signaling its importance to the brain. 

It's crucial to understand a concept before using spaced repetition.  Don't simply create flashcards for things you don't understand.  Invest time in comprehension and understanding the big picture first. This leads us into our next topic Chunking!

Chunking

Network engineering often involves abstract concepts that are difficult to grasp, especially when explaining them to others.  This course emphasized the importance of relating abstract topics to concrete, relatable examples.

Humans evolved to learn through visual and spatial information.  The best way to learn and develop deep understanding is to create metaphors or analogies for new information.  I used to struggle with making perfect analogies, but Oakley points out that metaphors, like the OSI model, are simply models and are never flawless.  If a metaphor covers the basic ideas and facilitates understanding, it's sufficient.

Chunking involves breaking down complex information into smaller, manageable units.  Instead of trying to understand QoS as a whole, break it down into classification, marking, queuing, and congestion management.  Each chunk becomes a building block for understanding the larger picture. Oakley explains that there are two ways to approach learning: the "what" (chunking—grouping related items) and the "why" (big-picture understanding). Combining these creates the "how" (context), leading to a deeper understanding. 

To maximize chunking, I use the acronym FUP: Focused attention, Understanding, and Practice.  Chunking is a strategy used during encoding (how you ingest information).  Effective chunking requires FUP. Focused attention is self-explanatory. It leads to understanding, the ability to articulate the topic at a high level.  This then leads to practice (spaced repetition) to further ingrain the knowledge.

Sleep and Exercise

This section resonated deeply. Sleep and exercise are often taken for granted.  In high school, I barely slept, often escaping reality through video games.  I lacked direction, while others seemed to have plans for travel, families, and other things I didn't care about.  Now, having found my purpose in network engineering, I see its power and potential impact, which excites me immensely.

Aim for eight hours of sleep.  Oakley explains that sleep consolidates information from the previous day and removes harmful brain toxins.  We need sleep to function at our peak. 

Exercise had recently fallen out of my routine, but I've vowed to reinstate it.  In fact, after writing this, I'm heading to the gym for leg day.  
  
  
  

Conclusion  
  

In conclusion, Barbara Oakley's "Learning How to Learn" course has been a truly transformative experience.  It has provided me with a practical and scientifically grounded framework for understanding how we learn and how to optimize that process.  From the power of focused and diffuse thinking to the strategic application of interleaving, spaced repetition, and chunking, the techniques presented in this course have equipped me with a powerful toolkit for lifelong learning. 

This course isn't just about passing tests; it's about developing a deeper, more flexible, and enduring understanding of any subject.  I'm confident that the principles I've learned will not only enhance my immediate studies but also serve me throughout my career and beyond.  Thank you, Barbara Oakley, for sharing your insights and empowering learners like me to unlock our full potential.  I wholeheartedly recommend this course to anyone seeking to improve their learning skills and embrace the joy of lifelong learning.
