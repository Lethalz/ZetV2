_Captivate_ (2017) is a social skills book in which author Vanessa van Edwards shares strategies for learning social skills, as well as a variety of social tips and insights on how to captivate, gain power and status, and make others like you.

## Bullet Summary

- Learn the 3 layers of personality types and tailor your communication to them
- Gesticulate as much as possible when giving a presentation
- Listen to what people brag about and complain about to find their values


## **#1. Do What You Like**

Vanessa says that “always say yes” is terrible advice and that you will not be successful following the “fake it until you make it mantra”.

She says instead you should develop your own social game plan. Find out what you like socially and make those your thriving locations.

**My note:**  
fair point, but if you’re really serious about getting good, you should push yourself.

1. Staying at the edge of your comfort zone helps a lot in improving quickly
2.  You can “force” yourself into something and _still_ enjoy it. Often the first few minutes are tough and then it gets fun.

The mindset is: stick through your fears long enough, they will become your addictions.

### Social Spots

Vanessa says social events often will have spots highly conducive to positive interactions and other spots which should be avoided.

The entrance should be avoided, for example, while a great spot is right at the exit of the buffet or the bar.  
Once people got their food or drink they are often desperate to speak to someone.

## **#2. Make a Great First Impression**

Vanessa says we decide whether or not we like someone long before we first hear them speak.

We quickly try to answer three questions about people we meet.  
Are you:

- friend or foe (you answer it with a hands gesture);
- winner or loser (you answer with body language and posture);
- ally or enemy (you answer it with eye contact)?

**Hand Gestures:** Vanessa says pockets are “murderers of rapport” and you should use hand gestures and show your hands as much as possible.

**Body Language:** ***Winners take up more space*** with power poses, and Vanessa says you should always keep a good posture and open body language. Also, she reminds us that power poses give us confidence and weaker poses make us feel unconfident. So when checking our phone we should raise it up.

**Eye Contact**: looking at someone a lot says to that person “I like you”. Hold eye contact to produce trust and gaze to build connection. Vanessa van Edwards mentions Brene Brown’s TedTalk and how she used eye contact to build a connection with the audience 

I think it’s a bit preposterous to say “you answer this question with the hands and that question with body language”. All parts co-exist and co-contribute. Eye contact won’t only tell us “ally or enemy”, but also if we’re “winners or losers”.

## **#3. Sparks**

Vanessa talks a lot about “hot buttons” -what people love- and being unique.
As humans we are intrigued by the novel things in life, so as much as possible do/say something new you will catch peoples attention this way.

Come up with new ways to say the same things, for example i could say :
- I'm a network engineer
- I make sure you can wake up and watch youtube
- I turn the internet on in the morning

These may be bad examples but in every case try and be different.

## **#4. Be Interested**

_Captivate_ says that talking about ourselves releases dopamine and makes us feel good.

Hence, quoting Carnegie with “to be interesting be interested”, the gist is that you should talk less and listen more.

## **#5. Highlighting**

Part of the highlighting method:

- celebrate other people’s successes as if they were your own
- introduce people with a big explanatory compliment
- let people impress you rather than trying to impress them

## **#6. How to Be Likeable**

Vanessa says we like people who are like us because it’s more likely we’ll get along well with each other similarity principle of liking  We like people who are dressed like us and think like us.

_Captivate_ righteously reminds us that one of the biggest mistakes people do is to highlight differences rather than similarities.

I personally think it comes down to three steps mark manson came to the same conclusions in [[Models]] 

1. Lifestyle
2. Honesty/Vulnerability
3. Action

1. Lifestyle - Find commonalities with the other person and go deeper by asking why
2. Honesty - Make your intentions known "My goal is to learn about you and your success" people can sense honesty. 
3. Action - Once you get to that point take action , offer to help, make the call, hand the person your phone, dont be afraid the worst they can say is no.



## Part 2 : The first 5 Hours

## **#7. Crack Someone’s Personality**

>Getting the best out of people is like solving a puzzle. - Vanessa

Vanessa delves into the [Big Five personality traits](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-6494.1992.tb00970.x/full): Openness, consciousness, extroversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism (OCEAN).

- **Openness**: how open you are to new ideas and trying new things (Variety seeker or routine person).
	- High - enjoys novelty, change, and adventure
	- Lowe - savors traditions, routines, and habits
- **Consciousness** measures your self-discipline. High tend to have to-do lists, low ones find strict schedules constrictive.
	- High -  Loves to-do lists, organizations, and schedules.
	- Low - typically prefers big ideas and strategy. Might find lists and shedules stifling and overwhelming
- **Extroversion**: high get energy from being with people and tend to be cheerful and talkative; low drain energy from being with people and crave being alone;
	- High - Gets energy from being with people. Tends to be cheerful and seeks out social time.
	- Low - Craves alone time and finds being with people draining
- **Agreeableness**: how you work with others, empathy, and forgiveness. High are empathetic and easy to get along with; low is more analytical, like to take decisions without emotions and tend to be more skeptical.
	- High - Easy to get along with, very empathetic, and enjoys caring for others
	- Low - More analytical, practical, and skeptical - prefers to keep emotions out of decisions.
- **Neuroticisms** how you approach worry and how emotionally reactive you are to your environment. 
	- High - Tends to be a worrier. Frequently experiences mood swings.
	- Low - Typically calm stable and has very little mood fluctuations

Vanessa says that when she started understanding people through the lenses of the Big Five personality traits, her conversation and human interactions started flowing much more smoothly.


Once you learn these traits you can base the way you talk to them act around them, mold their environment to their strengths.


## **#8. Appreciate**

Vanessa quotes Gary Chapman 5 love languages to explain the different ways people show appreciation for one another:

- **Words of Affirmation:** Show love with words
- **Gifts:** Show love with gifts or with tokens
- **Physical Touch:** Show love with physical touch such as hugs, caressing, cuddling
- **Service:** Show love by helping someone out
- **Quality Time:** Show love by spending time with the people they love

Many issues in a relationship can be explained by the couple having different ways of expressing their love. If you’re curious about your love language you can take the test here.

When you figure out a person's love language you find out how they like to be appreciated in turn the things you provide when you are grateful to them becomes two-fold.




## **#9. Values**

Vanessa van Edwards says all interactions are transactions 

The major resources being traded are:

- **Love**: gaining acceptance, affection and likability;
-  **Service**: support and care;
- **Status**: responsibility, praise and titles to evoke pride;
- **Money**: currency;
- **Goods**: tangible products;
- **Information**: advice, ideas and teaching.

We need all 6 but we take what we need most and give what we have in abundance. For example, people with low self-esteem look for likes on their Facebook pages.

When you find out someones core values you learn what motivate their decisions, like Manny and Unsals main drives are money and status .

### How To Find Out People’s Values

_Captivate_ explains that a great way to find out people’s values is to look at what they complain about or what they brag about.

## **#10. How to Lead People**

If you want to get buy-in, you have to explain [[Start With Why | your why]]

And to give control and ownership, avoid micromanaging and let people own their tasks 

What I loved most about this chapter is Vanessa’s great advice on how to best give tasks: you don’t just assign them, but give them to the people with the right skill.

And then… ?

Then tell them they are the best for it because they are the most talented for it.



## **#11.** **How to Deal With Difficult People**

Vanessa van Edwards speaks a bit about the low road and high road and “emotion hijacking” when our fears take us over.

She then goes on with a brilliant dialogue between a man and a woman to point out that when someone complains to us we should resist the urge of going into solution mode and do listen longer instead.

## **#12. Engage: How to Turn People On**

Popular people are more attuned to other people’s popularity.

They are more attuned to social signals, social hierarchy, and relationships. Popular people also care more about these topics.

So if you want to be popular, I’m afraid that means you need to be attuned to the game of popularity.

## CONS

- **Mayers-Briggs Test**

This test is (not so good) pop psychology.

Say the psychologist researchers authors of the _[Handbook of Research Methods in Social & Personality Psychology](https://thepowermoves.com/handbook-of-research-methods-in-social-personality-psych-summary/):_

> Without much evidence for its external, structural, or substantive validity, the MBTI nonetheless became the most popular personality questionnaire in this country.

- **Lots Upsell** 

_Captivate_ has constant invites to check Vanessa’s website.

The advertised link did not take me to any resource though but to a sign-up page.  
That felt a bit wrong to me.

- **Some Counterproductive Tips**

My opinion is that some tips can be counterproductive.

For example, you don’t ask a woman if she “can give you her number”.

And you won’t look socially appealing starting a convo by saying you want to “test a convo starter”.

## Captivate Review

_Captivate_ introduced me to some new great ideas.

Some other parts, I don’t fully agree with. In my opinion, _Captivate_ is a bit too much into “standing out” and “being unique”.  
But seeking uniqueness is not an inherently high-quality trait.
