# Pre-suasion

# What is Pre-Suasion?

PRE-suasion — the process of arranging for recipients to be receptive to a message BEFORE they encounter it.

It is essentially the psychological frame you deliver your message in.

And that frame matters.

A lot.

# How To Become A Master of Pre-Suasion

# 1) Attention

When you pay attention to something it will automatically become more important to you, or it will at least seem that way.

Think about the phrase we use for attention, we say 'pay' attention as if it is a form of currency. 


Mainstream media take advantage of that on a daily basis.

**They control what is being talked about.**

The lesson here is attention = importance. If you want to persuade anyone of anything you need to be able to capture, hold and direct their attention.

# 1) How To Change The Direction Of Someone’s Attention

In the most trivial argument you might have at work or at home, you are trying to convince someone by giving them reasons. But, that is typically the hardest way to change someone’s mind.

A much easier and powerful tactic is to change what that person is paying attention to. As attention is limited and you can typically pay attention to one thing at a time, when something new emerges, you almost immediately let go of the old.

# 2) How To Ask The “Right” Questions

In one Canadian study people were asked one of two questions — are you “happy” with your social life or are you “UNhappy” with your social life?

Although the questions might seem identical to most, the results with nothing short of surprising.

> _The people who were asked if they are UNhappy were 375% more likely to say they were._

How the question was phrased made one part of the people think about their happiness and the other about their unhappiness, hence the big difference in the results.

# 3) How To GRAB Attention

Before you can direct someone’s attention, you first need to be able to grab it.

Use the time tested proven attention grabbers:

1. **SEX** — the main reason you see models on magazine covers and in advertisements.
2. **DANGER** — similar tactic to sex, but with the opposite message. Dangers and threats are attention magnets.
3. **NOVELTY** — In order for something to be noticed, it must stand out, be different, be new.
4. **Suspense** - Keeping people suspended on what could happen next is a big strength. (think about how women love mysterious men)

# 4) How To HOLD Attention

Once you have [grabbed that valuable attention](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chcYXBsNL1A), how can you hold it?

By using the most interesting person in the world to every person — **themselves**.

Making the conversation about the other person by using “YOU” instead of “people” or “they” will make them pay attention.

Arguments are never as convincing as counter-arguments.

# 2) Unity

What Is Unity?

The feeling of being part of something bigger than yourself. It can be shared group, a shared identity or even a shared world view.

When a sports team wins or loses, their fans don’t say “the team lost” or “they lost”, they typically say WE lost.

Similarly, religious people tend to refer to their churches as “our church”.

Use language and actions to make people feel they are part of something bigger AND that you are one of them. Invoke unity and you can influence them more powerfully.

# 3) Connections

The final part of pre-suasion is “connections”.

If you manage to engineer new or different mention connections, you can influence people much easier.

Almost all big companies use this powerful tactic as part of their branding.

That is why when you think of Mercedes Benz, you think of luxury and when you think of Wal-Mart, you think of convenience and low prices.

# How To Pre-Suade In Just 3 Steps

Let’s sum it all up — the next time you want to persuade someone keep these 3 things in mind:

1. **Attention** — where is it directed and can you hold it?
2. **Unity** — are you part of the team, or them? Can you demonstrate that?
3. **Connections** — what positive mental connections and associations are you making?
