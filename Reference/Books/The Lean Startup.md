# The Lean Startup 
# Part 1 : Vision

## Synopsis 
_The Lean Startup_ was inspired by Toyota’s lean manufacturing revolution. This revolution incorporated: __attending to the ideas and knowledge of the workers, making smaller batch sizes, implementing just-in-time production, and accelerating cycle times.__

## Chapter 1 : Start
Today , we have more entrepreneurs **than we have ever had**. That is in part to *technology* and the paths it creates. One of the *essential* skills for entrepreneurs is **management**.

However, a startups' management *should not be traditional.* Every startup has a **growth engine** : **processes and structures that help them grow.** 

*Feedback* is key to this engine, it helps startups *catch problems as early as possible*.

Startups use strategies to achieve their *vision*, but their product is ever-changing and will require ever-changing strategies to succeed.
In a startup, *customer needs are just as important* as speed, efficiency and persistence.

In addition to customer feedback, startups also need to **utilize failures** as opportunities to make changes. 
As the startup develops, products will be tested, and shortfalls identified. In established businesses, shortfalls are generally seen in a negative light. However, **failure is integral** to startup development and should be investigated rather than forgotten.

## Chapter 2 : Learn

> _“A startup is an institution that creates new products or services in an atmosphere of uncertainty.”
>  -Eric Ries

Eric places great importance on ensuring that startup managers understand the terms most relevant to their company.

-   _Institution_ – Startups are institutions built by entrepreneurs who hire employees and direct their activities. Startups revolve around innovative products, but it is also important to remember they are still an institution.
-   *Product* – For startups, your product must be something new and innovative.
-   _Uncertainty –_ Most companies can adopt traditional management techniques. There is a degree of uncertainty with startups and the management techniques used should reflect this uncertainty.

## Chapter 3: Learn

>“After more than ten years as an entrepreneur, I came to reject that line of thinking. I have learned from both my own successes and failures and those of many others that it’s the boring stuff that matters the most. Startup success is not a consequence of good genes or being in the right place at the right time. Startup success can be engineered by following the right process, which means it can be learned, which means it can be taught.” 
>– Eric Ries

Traditionally, people measure progress by a company’s ability to stick to their plans, produce high-quality work, and stay within its budget. However, these measures of progress do not guarantee your customers will buy your product. Therefore, this is why **learning from your mistakes is so important.** Traditional companies will see mistakes as waste; startup companies should **see mistakes as opportunities**.

It is also crucial that startups **learn from their company’s data**. There is a tendency for startups to delay obtaining hard numbers. One reason for this is that people are more likely to invest in a startup when there’s no sales or revenue data. The lack of data can let investors’ imagination run wild. However, this does not mean startups should avoid obtaining this data. **The most important data is your customers’ feedback.** *The sooner you can understand what your customers think about your product,* **the sooner you can improve your product.** These improvements reduce the time spent in the development process.

With startups, there are many unknowns. **Learning is essential to their development.** Validated learning utilizes customers’ data to demonstrate progress in a chaotic and changing environment. It’s quick and easy.

Here are some of the tactics that Ries and IMVU used when developing their startup: 

1.  Launched a low-quality early prototype
2.  Charged customers from day one
3.  Used low-volume revenue targets to drive accountability

Each of these steps is a good starting point, but you should also be adapting these steps depending on your company.

## Chapter 4: Experiment

Launching a new product should be approached like a scientific experiment. As with scientific experiments, Eric recommends producing hypotheses and testing these predictions.

Directly testing our assumptions gives us a considerable amount of information. The two most important assumptions are the **_value hypothesis_ and _growth hypothesis_.** 

**Value hypotheses** asks *whether the product delivers value to the customer.* The best way to answer this question is through **experimentation.** 
1. **Test the growth hypothesis** to see how customers discover the new product
2. **Test behavior** to see if your assumptions are correct.

#### Build-Measure-Learn Feedback Loop

>“As you consider building your own minimum viable product, let this simple rule suffice: remove any feature, process, or effort that does not contribute directly to the learning you seek.”
> – Eric Ries

As well as developing hypotheses, it is also vital that a startup considers the fundamentals:

-   Will consumers believe they need your product?
-   If consumers need your product, why will they prefer your product to your competitors?
-   Even if consumers need and want your product, is it viable to create?

You want to check these fundamentals before you even consider building a product and testing its viability. 

The **Build-Measure-Learn** feedback loop is crucial once you have established these fundamentals. Eric recommends starting this loop with your **Minimal Viable Product** (MVP). The **MVP** is *the simplest version* of your product that can be put through the build-measure-learn feedback loop.

Once you have identified your MVP, you have to be willing to ***plan with the expectation of pivoting***. We can make predictions, but the world is ever-changing. Your startup’s strategy will need to pivot based on circumstances.


# Part 2: Steer
## Chapter 5: Leap

A startup builds a product, and customers interact with it. These interactions create information in the form of feedback. This feedback should be obtained and utilized to improve the next iteration of the product. **Your customers’ feedback is far more critical than the money generated from early sales.** 

Eric suggests that many of us will be more skilled in one of the build-measure-learn feedback loop features. However, **each of these steps is integral and must not be left out.** The goal is to complete a feedback loop within the *shortest possible cycle time.*

Every startup contends with *unique conditions.* Therefore, Eric does not recommend copying what others do in the expectation of success. Instead, your startup’s strategy should be adapted to your specific circumstances. Eric states that **every company’s strategy is built on assumptions.** In traditional companies, these assumptions are challenged through data. However, at the beginning of a startup, there is a lack of data. Therefore, **entrepreneurs often have to focus on their intuition.** Eric describes this as the *leap of faith.* 

*As soon as data is available*, **entrepreneurs should be using it to test their intuitive assumptions.** The **minimum viable product (MVP)** is essential for this initial testing. The minimum viable product allows you to obtain data related to your assumptions. This is the build phase of the loop.

Use **innovative accounting** to ensure that you are creating a product that people will want. **Innovative accounting** involves creating learning milestones to *track your progress*. After receiving feedback from consumers, you can **identify** if you are on track with your goals. If your company is *not matching their initial goals*, you **need** to make the **active decision to pivot.** Additionally, if one of our assumptions is false, we will need to develop a new strategy. One of the lean startup method’s fundamentals is that **companies need to learn to pivot sooner rather than later.** *Changing your assumptions and approach early on will help save the company **time and money**.* 

It comes back to the value hypothesis and the growth hypothesis. You need to understand **how the product creates or destroys value,** as well as how it **creates or destroys growth.** 

### Chapter 6: Test

“The point is not to find the average customer but to find early adopters: the customers who feel the need for the product most acutely. Those customers tend to be more forgiving of mistakes and are especially eager to give feedback.” – Eric Ries

Your MVP should be geared towards the early adopters rather than the mainstream consumers. Your early adopters are going to be the first consumers for innovative products. Hence, they will have a good understanding of the intricate details that are holding the product back. For early adopters, the idea is more important than the MVP’s quality. Therefore, strip your ideas back for the MVP and only include the features the early adopters will care about.

One type of MVP that can be particularly useful is the concierge MVP. This type of MVP provides the opportunity for consumers to engage with the product fully. For example, you might develop a prototype of your product. This MVP type will help you better learn precisely what the customer needs and wants from your product. You can then make refinements based on the feedback of these consumers. The thoughts of your customers should always drive your design. Eric provides the example of Aardvark as a company that developed a prototype to test customer responses before releasing their social network.

Although creating MVPs is extremely important, they should also be approached with caution. It can be risky to launch an MVP without a patent as it can expose breakthrough innovation to competitors. Eric points out, though, that big companies very rarely care about the ideas of startups. As a startup, you are struggling for anybody to notice you, so having your ideas stolen should be the least of your worries. 

Finally, Eric suggests that you must be persistent with your testing. It is easy to become impatient and release a product without thorough testing. However, you must gather this information to release the best version of your product based on the available information. 

### Chapter 7: Measure

The next stage of the lean startup method is to measure your company’s progress. However, standard accounting practices are not generally applicable to startups. Instead, the aforementioned innovative accounting should be used. Eric recommends:

1.  Use an MVP to establish your baseline data
2.  Improve and fine-tune your product based on this data
3.  If your product’s data improves you should establish a new baseline
4.  Start the process again

Your first MVP should be designed to test the riskiest assumptions you have placed in your business plan. 

Beware of vanity metrics. Business can be measured in many ways, but we are all partial to numbers that make us look better. Be honest with yourself. Here are two analyses that can be useful for startups:

1.  Do a _cohort analysis_. A cohort analysis involves breaking your consumers down into cohort groups. Then, you look at the performance of your product within different cohorts. This type of analysis can help you to better understand whether real growth is happening
2.  _Split tests_ can help. Giving different versions of a product to different people can help refine what the customer does and does not want. If you test extra features, but it doesn’t change customer behavior, ask whether those features matter.

Metrics should be actionable, accessible, and auditable:

-   Actionable — It has to show clear cause and effect; no vanity metrics allowed.
-   Accessible — People need to understand the data. Using cohort-based reports can help people better understand real-life behaviors and beliefs
-   Auditable — Everyone in the company should have faith in the metrics. Additionally, the way that these metrics are created and displayed should be made fully available to everyone. Finally, managers should avoid only looking at the data and also talk to real customers

### Chapter 8: Pivot (or Persevere)

If an idea isn’t working out, you need to change your strategy.

When you pivot, you don’t throw everything out and start over. Instead, you are using your current product as a foundation and utilizing the knowledge you have learned to pivot your product.

Eric describes knowing when to pivot as an art form. Telltale signs that you may need to pivot are less effective product experiments and unproductive product development.

Being willing to pivot is a courageous decision. Pivoting is an admission of failure, and this is something we all struggle to do. However, many startups fail because they are not willing to accept they need to pivot.

Deciding to pivot requires an empirical and impartial approach. Eric outlines the idea of pivot or persevere meetings. These meetings should be held regularly and attended by all of the product development and business leadership teams. These meetings should adopt the following structure:

-   The product development team should report its metrics regarding previous performance. Plus, adjusted goals based on these metrics
-   The business leadership team should provide a better understanding of the customers
-   Other specialists and advisors can be added depending on the agenda of the meeting

Ries details a “catalog of pivots:” descriptions of different ways to change direction. However, it is also important to remember that there is no set formula to follow. These descriptions should be used as a starting point:

-   Zoom in – Try and focus on a small part of your previous strategy or a feature of your product. Make this feature the entirety of your product
-   Zoom out – Expand your scope to encompass different ideas of the product
-   Focus on the good – Focus on the positive feedback given about your previous iteration and bring that forward to your next product

Eric also provides multiple other pivots. Here is a list of the remaining pivots:

-   Platform pivot
-   Business architect pivot
-   Value capture pivot
-   Engine of growth pivot
-   Channel pivot
-   Technology pivot

Despite the wide variety of pivots, the most important thing is the strategy behind the pivot. You must be pivoting at the right time and for the right reasons. Plus, do not be afraid to use more than one type of pivot.
