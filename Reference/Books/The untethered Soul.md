# The untethered Soul

## #1: Solve Problems Based on Your Inside World
"I" will never be content, there will always be something that isn't good enough for me in my head. Instead of fighting or trying to appease the voice in your head find out where that feeling is coming from. Whether it's jelousy, fear, anger , or disgust. 

"How you gon win when you ain't right within"


## #2: Get to Know Your Inside Voice

Examine your inner voice, observe what it says, get to know it better, so you can have more control over it in the future. This voice is not you, but a **symptom** of you and all your held expeirences. This internal narration helps to analyze the world around you and re-create this world within you.

TO avoid living in your mind is to overcome the part of you that needs to stay there.
You are not the voice in your head you are the one observing that voice.


## #3: Tackle Autopilot to Stop Being Absorbed By Your Inside Voice

Learn to pull yourself from autopilot when engaging in any activity, so you can properly experience everything. 
Learn to see your thoughts as a learning lession and always try and be objective.

One way i like doing this is thinking about me here on earth and zooming out further and further till im in space realizing I'm so small and insignificant but still here


## #4: Your Inside Voice Is Your Inner Thorn

Remove your inner thorn don't protect it. Your inner voice's negative dispositions aren't coming from you.

Look deep into yourself  with meditation and confront your thorns and realize they arent as significant as you originally thought.


## #5: A Healthy Heart Allows Energy to Flow

A **healthy** heart’s natural state will allow energy to *flow*, encouraging inspiration, love, and openness. Your heart helps you research your highest state, which is simply the result of being **completely open**. 

So, don’t sell yourself short by **neglecting** your heart and closing up. Your heart is the antidote to your mind. At some point in your journey, you will be guided by your heart rather than worrying about your mind.

## #6: Openness Is Essential for Energy Production


Staying open is the key to happiness and love. Remaining open will lead to waves of uplifting energy filling your heart. Energy is so essential that you should never leave it to chance. You will receive more energy if you stay open. 

I have felt this openess and i have felt the opposite and i would choose being open everytime. You don't road-rage , you don't get angry or annoyed at things that are insignificant.


## #7: Let Go of Things to Become Liberated

Freedom and liberation are the keys to avoiding a closed mind.

Everything will be okay as soon as you are okay with everything.


## Free Your Soul By Not Worrying About Others

Don't worry about being liked by others.

Focus on loving yourself and others will come. 

Your thoughts and emotions cannot fix the external problems around you.
Instead, use your thoughts to ponder ideas, solve problems and serve others.


## #9: Freedom and Liberation Will Not Be Pain-Free

True spiritual growth, freedom and transformation will not be free of pain. Instead, you have to learn to come to peace with pain. Most people always try to avoid pain, but this means pain is running their lives. 

Years of attempting to avoid pain will have created layers of deep sensitivity to external events. This is because the pain is still being processed, just deeper down.

## #10: Take Down Your Walls to Free Your Consciousness

You've spent your whole life building a safe, comfy house in your head. Never needed to leave or be bother by anything outside. But **"There is no growth in the comfort zone and no comfort in the growth zone"**
As you take down the walls and go deeper into yourself, you will realize a never-changing part of yourself. 
This is your **sense of awareness**. This is your **consciousness**. This part of you is **aware** of your thoughts, experiences, and emotions. So, your consciousness is the root of your “_Self_.”


## #11: Destroying False Solidity Will Bring You Peace

Letting go is always a positive action. 
It’s a deep inner release that is a spiritual path in and of itself. 

Once you learn to let go of false solidity, you will experience permanent peace, joy, and happiness. 

Even after letting go, you will still have thoughts, emotions, and a self-concept. But, they will be merely one small part of what you experience rather than the entirety of your experience. 

After letting go, you will not identify with anything outside your sense of Self.

## #12: Don't Hold on to expierences Good or Bad

Learn to let things pass through you instead of holding on the them for the future enjoy them for what they are now, whether good or bad. Because you only have one live and all of it is part of the expeirence.

Begin healthy wouldn't feel as good if there was no pain.
Beling alive wouldnt be as exciting if there wasn't death.

"Your experiences are **not you**; they are only the contents of your consciousness. What you are is the conscious observer of those contents." - Eckhart Tolle

## #15: Death Teaches Us Unique Lessons

2.  A wise person realizes that when you breathe out, you may not breathe in again.
3.  Any time you are struggling with something, think of death.
4.  Whatever you are doing right now, someone was doing that when they died.
5.  No matter what you’re doing, you can be sure someone died that way.
