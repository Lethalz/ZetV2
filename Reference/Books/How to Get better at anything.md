## Ch 1 : Problem Solving Is Search


Learning is a team effort, you dont know what you dont know.

Because we are becoming more connected, there is more exposure to everything. 

Before if you wanted to become a master at something you had to climb up some tall mystical mountain and find a secluded master to teach you what he learned from either his master or trial and error

Because of technology and expoursure learning is streamlined, we can learn so much from our peers. we  dont need to go through the trial and error process because we can "see" what works for others.



## Ch 2 : Creativity Begins with Copying

Although imitation seems an archaic way of learning, copying as humans are one of our main ways to learn new concepts. Our brain works best in that way. Some people are of the school that say learning is best done alone and with a problem. but studies suggest otherwise. Instruction then practice is the best way to tackle a new subject.

Without learning from others we become inefficient and are prone to mistakes.
Without practice we miss out on the process of making these skills automatic.

Instruction is key but so is applied practice after being shown what to do.


## Ch 3 : Success is the best teacher

Success is one of the best motivators. 

Look for those little wins early on those will help you push through the trials later on..
Think.
