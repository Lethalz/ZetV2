# Deep Work

## **Introduction**

What is Deep Work?

**Deep Work** is Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that pushes your cognitive capabilities past mediocre.
	It's a necessary componant to becoming a great tech/dev in this day and age where everything is constantly shifting and changing.

The Dichotomy of Deep Work is *shallow work* 
	- Distracted
	- Non-cognitively demanding
	- Does not tend to create new value in the world.
**The more time that you spend in this state is, the harder it is to actually perform deep work.**

# Part 1: The Idea
## Chapter One: Deep Work is Valuable

Two core abilities to thrive in the new technological market:
1. The ability to master hard things. (Over-and-Over)
2. The ability to produce at an elite level. (Quality and Speed)
Deep Work is piviotal to creating these two abilities.

Deliberate Practice :
1. Your attention is focused tightly on a specific skill you are trying to improve or master
		deliberate practice cannot exist alongside distraction, your practice must be deliberate and important.
2. Recieve feedback so you can correct your approach to keep your attention where it's most productive
		To learn is an act of deep work, if you're comfortable going deep you'll be comfortable lmastering the complex systems and skills needed to thrive.

**High-Quality Work Produced = (Time Spent) x (Intensity of Focus)**

This formula is simple, to produce at your peak level you need to work for extended periods with full concentration on a single task free from distraction; or simply practice deep work.

## Chapter 2 : Deep Work is Rare

According to a study quoted by the book. ANY interruption, no matter how miniscule, delays the total time required to complete a task by a significant amount. Creating a space where distractions come less often is beneficial to deep work.

### The principle of Least Resistance
Without clear feedback on the impact of various behaviors to the bottom line, we will tend toward behaviors that are the easiest at the moment. In other words, the activities that make us seem productive and valuable in that instance.

### Busyness as a Proxy for Productivity

"Clarity about what matters provides clarity about what does not."

**Knowledge workers want to prove that they’re productive members of the team.**
This causes them to look busy or actually be more busy to appear more productive/valuable.
Work nowadays isn't time spent = value.
Become efficient at what you do not more busy.

##  **Chapter Three: Deep Work Is Meaningful**

Attention or what we chose to focus on is a pretty defining quality of our life. We tend to place alot of emphasis on our circumstances. 
What you think, do, or love is the sum of what you focus on.
Don't focus on the shallow, trivial things in life, otherwise you will fall into the trap of everyone else. 
Focus on the BIG PICTURE.

Life is more about how we perceive the events that happen to us, rather than the events themselves.

In conclusion to increase the time you spend in a **state of depth** is to leverage the complex machinery of the human brain in a way that maximizes the meaning and satisfaction you’ll associate with your working life.

> _“Man is not worried by real problems so much as by his imagined anxieties about real problems.”_
> 	**_Epictetus_**

To build your working life around the experience of flow produced by deep work is a proven path to deep satisfaction. As a Man, your work is your life's purpose and the pride you take in that fuels the pride in yourself.

Whether you’re a writer, marketer, consultant, or lawyer: Your work is craft, and if you hone your ability and apply it with respect and care, then you can generate meaning in the daily efforts of your work.

With everything you do, go granular, the small things count in your work of art.

# Part 2 : The Rules

## Rule 1: Work deep - How to work deep

You have a finite amount of willpower that becomes depleted as you use it.
This is huge because we normally think of willpower as something you're born with, but no, its something you can work on actively.

#### Different Types of Depth 

#### Monastic
- Doing one thing exceptionally well.
- Extreme
- Cut out all shallow work. 

#### Bimodal
- Divide your time
- Dedicate clear deep work time, leave the rest to anything else
- 7-day week, maybe 4 days of deep workd

#### Rhythmic
- habitual deep work
- chain method
- Do the work everyday
- At least once

#### Journalistic
- Liberal 
- Fit it in whereever you can 
- Writers mode

### Ritualize

- Waiting for inspiration to strike is a terrible, terrible plan.
- Ignore Inspiration.
- To make the most out of your deep work sessions, build rituals of the same level of strictness and idiosyncrasy as the important thinkers of the world.
- People like NBA players have rituals before games to get them into this state of flow.#

### **Make Grand Gestures**

By leveraging a radical change to your normal environment, coupled perhaps with a significant investment of effort or money, all dedicated toward supporting a deep work task, you increase the perceived importance of the task.

This boost in importance reduces your mind’s instinct to procrastinate and delivers an injection of motivation and energy.

I.e. 
Bill Gates Think-Weeks
J. K rowling, Buying a hotel to write.

### **Execute Like a Business**

#### **Discipline 1: Focus on the Wildly Important**

“The more you try to do, the less you actually accomplish.”
	Execution should be aimed at a few “wildly important goals.”

Don’t try to say “no” to the trivial distractions you find on the information smorgasbord; try to say “yes” to the subject that arouses a terrifying longing, and let the terrifying longing crowd out everything else.

The way to discover a terrifying longing is to liberate yourself from the self-censoring labels you began to tell yourself over the course of your mis-education.

Focus on the external objects of fascination, not on whom you think you are.

#### Discipline 2: Act on the Lead Measures

Two types of metrics for measuring success:
Lag measures - describe the thing you're ultimately trying to imporve
Lead measures – measures the new behaviors that will drive succes on the lag measures

lead measures turn your attention to improving the behaviors you directly control in the near future that will then have a positive impact on your long-term goals.

**relevant lead measure:** time spent in a state of deep work dedicated toward your wildly important goal.

#### **Discipline 3: Keep a Compelling Scoreboard**

People play differently when they are keeping score

provides a reinforcing source of motivation.

Once one finds success in a lead measure perpetuation of that lead measure becomes easier
short-term pain = long-term gain

hour spent in deep work = lead measure

Mark key advances to the hour

#### **Discipline 4: Create a Cadence of Accountability**

Review good weeks and pinpoint what went wrong on bad weeks



---   
### Be Lazy

If you need more time, then extend your workday, but once you shut down, your mind must be left free

I have this problem sometimes its hard to let go of what you need to do.

#### **Reason 1: Downtime Aids Insights**
providing your conscious brain time to rest enables your unconscious mind to take a shift sorting through your most complex professional challenges.

This is like when i was stresing abou fixing the PDF  and the solution came to me in a dream


#### **Reason 2: Downtime Helps Recharge the Energy Needed to Work Deeply**

Only the confidence that you’re done with work until the next day can convince your brain to downshift to the level where it can begin to recharge for the next day to follow


#### **Reason 3: The Work That Evening Downtime Replaces Is Usually Not That Important**

once your workday shuts down, you cannot allow even the smallest incursion of professional concerns into your field of attention.

Studies show that our best work is done at the beginning of the day and the lnger we work the less efficent our brain are.

Have a way to tell yourself that your workday is complete 

Maybe after your last task say 
"Whew that was easy"


**When you work, work hard. When you’re done, be done**

Subpar forced work is worse than no work at all.


## **Rule 2: Embrace Boredom**

You cannot consider yourself as fulfilling this daily obligation unless you have stretched to the reaches of your mental capacity.

- The ability to concentrate intensely is a skill that must be trained.
- Efforts to deepen your focus will struggle if you don’t simultaneously wean your mind from a dependence on distraction.
- Once your brain has become accustomed to on-demand distraction,it’s hard to shake the addiction even when you want to concentrate.
- **Boredom is the catalyst to greatness** 
- If you're studying something and you yawn your brain is trying to get you to revert to the old ways 
- The more you ignore those tells the stroger you are building your mental muscles

## **Rule 3: Quit Social Media**

Quit for 30 days after ask these two questions.
1. Would the last thirty days have been notably better if I had been able to use this service? 
2. Did people care that I wasn’t using this service?

If your answer is “no” to both questions, quit the service permanently.

### **Don’t Use the Internet to Entertain Yourself**

Put more thought into your leisure time. In other words, this strategy suggests that when it comes to your relaxation, don’t default to whatever catches your attention at the moment, but instead dedicate some advance thinking to the question of how you want to spend your “day within a day.”

I think about this all the time when it comes to gaming. I love gaming but it is so unfuffilling, i promise you that there is going to be  a huge generation of unfuffilled human beings because of the way that video games are now. Find something that you enjoy, but that provides some meaning to your life, something like playing the guitar or learning a new language.

If you give your mind something meaningful to do throughout all your waking hours, you’ll end the day more fulfilled, and begin the next one more relaxed, than if you instead allow your mind to bathe for hours in semiconscious and unstructured Web surfing.

## **Rule 4: Drain the Shallows**

Deep work is exhausting because it pushes you toward the limit of your abilities

Even though we’re not capable of spending a full day in a state of blissful depth(deep work), this reality shouldn’t reduce the urgency of reducing shallow work, as the typical knowledge workday is more easily fragmented than many suspect.

An hour a day is  reasonable limit for new deep workers

### **Schedule Every Minute of Your Day**

Your goal is not to stick to a given schedule at all costs; it’s instead to maintain, at all times, a thoughtful say in what you’re doing with your time going forward—even if these decisions are reworked again and again as the day unfolds.

You should have an idea of what you are doing throughout the day and know whats important to you within that day. If you are having trouble filling up your schedule don't worry find those really pressing things that "need" to be on there and that should be enough.

If you are not sure how much time to block out for a given activity , block off a estimate amount of time and if you need more time for that activity if possible keep working on it. but dont stretch out anything that you already scheduled past the already alotted time.

### **Finish Your Work by Five Thirty**

5:30 or find a comfortable time for you , but you should use this time as a deadline becasue in theroy you should be able to do deep work and use up most of your mental capacity by then. If you arent getting work done by then , figure out whats going wrong and fix that.

### **Become Hard to Reach**
Become hard to reach in any medium , whether thats phone calls, text, email. 
But if you do need to answer be as detailed as possible and treat it like a work of art and try to get to the point not in a rushing matter but as to not mince words with the person.
No one is entitled to your time.

## **Conclusion**

The deep life, of course, is not for everybody. It requires hard work and drastic changes to your habits. For many, there’s a comfort in the artificial busyness of rapid e-mail messaging and social media posturing, while the deep life demands that you leave much of that behind. There’s also an uneasiness that surrounds any effort to produce the best things you’re capable of producing, as this forces you to confront the possibility that your best is not (yet) that good. It’s safer to comment on our culture than to step into the Rooseveltian ring and attempt to wrestle it into something better. 

But if you’re willing to sidestep these comforts and fears, and instead struggle to deploy your mind to its fullest capacity to create things that matter, then you’ll discover, as others have before you, that depth generates a life rich with productivity and meaning. 

Winifred Gallagher saying, “I’ll live the focused life, because it’s the best kind there is.”
