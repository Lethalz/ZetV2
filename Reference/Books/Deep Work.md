# Deep Work

## **Introduction**

What is Deep Work?

**Deep Work** is Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that pushes your cognitive capabilities past mediocre.
	It's a necessary componant to becoming a great tech/dev in this day and age where everything is constantly shifting and changing.

The Dichotomy of Deep Work is *shallow work* 
	- Distracted
	- Non-cognitively demanding
	- Does not tend to create new value in the world.
**The more time that you spend in this state is, the harder it is to actually perform deep work.**

# Part 1: The Idea
## Chapter One: Deep Work is Valuable

Two core abilities to thrive in the new technological market:
1. The ability to master hard things. (Over-and-Over)
2. The ability to produce at an elite level. (Quality and Speed)
Deep Work is piviotal to creating these two abilities.

Deliberate Practice :
1. Your attention is focused tightly on a specific skill you are trying to improve or master
		deliberate practice cannot exist alongside distraction, your practice must be deliberate and important.
2. Recieve feedback so you can correct your approach to keep your attention where it's most productive
		To learn is an act of deep work, if you're comfortable going deep you'll be comfortable lmastering the complex systems and skills needed to thrive.

**High-Quality Work Produced = (Time Spent) x (Intensity of Focus)**

This formula is simple, to produce at your peak level you need to work for extended periods with full concentration on a single task free from distraction; or simply practice deep work.

## Chapter 2 : Deep Work is Rare

According to a study quoted by the book. ANY interruption, no matter how miniscule, delays the total time required to complete a task by a significant amount. Creating a space where distractions come less often is beneficial to deep work.

### The principle of Least Resistance
Without clear feedback on the impact of various behaviors to the bottom line, we will tend toward behaviors that are the easiest at the moment. In other words, the activities that make us seem productive and valuable in that instance.

### Busyness as a Proxy for Productivity

"Clarity about what matters provides clarity about what does not."

**Knowledge workers want to prove that they’re productive members of the team.**
This causes them to look busy or actually be more busy to appear more productive/valuable.
Work nowadays isn't time spent = value.
Become efficient at what you do not more busy.

##  **Chapter Three: Deep Work Is Meaningful**

Attention or what we chose to focus on is a pretty defining quality of our life. We tend to place alot of emphasis on our circumstances. 
What you think, do, or love is the sum of what you focus on.
Don't focus on the shallow, trivial things in life, otherwise you will fall into the trap of everyone else. 
Focus on the BIG PICTURE.

Life is more about how we perceive the events that happen to us, rather than the events themselves.

In conclusion to increase the time you spend in a **state of depth** is to leverage the complex machinery of the human brain in a way that maximizes the meaning and satisfaction you’ll associate with your working life.

> _“Man is not worried by real problems so much as by his imagined anxieties about real problems.”_
> 	**_Epictetus_**

To build your working life around the experience of flow produced by deep work is a proven path to deep satisfaction. As a Man, your work is your life's purpose and the pride you take in that fuels the pride in yourself.

Whether you’re a writer, marketer, consultant, or lawyer: Your work is craft, and if you hone your ability and apply it with respect and care, then you can generate meaning in the daily efforts of your work.

With everything you do, go granular, the small things count in your work of art.
