## Introduction

As a leader we need to *prioritize*, that means dealing with the most immediate situation , threat or task first. 
We need to *execute* with no hesitation engaging any problem with complete focus in the present moment.
**Core mindset**: *Extreme Ownership*. Leaders must own everything in their world. There is no one else to blame.

1. Winning the war within.
2. The laws of combat.
3. Sustaining victory.

Each chapter focuses on a different leadership concept. 
Each chapter has 3 subsections.

1. Identifies leadership lesson learned from combat or training experience.
2. Explains leadership principle.
3. Demonstrates the principle application to the business world.

# **Part I: Winning the War Within**

## Chapter 1 : Extreme Ownership

Extreme Ownership means the leader must accept that he is *truly and ultimately responsible* for everything.

 - The leader must own everything in his world, and all responsibility for success and failure rests with him. **There is no one else to blame.**

Total responsibility for failure is difficult to accept, and Extreme Ownership when things go wrong demands *humility and courage.* Being able to accept Extreme Ownership when things go wrong is an absolute necessity to learning and growing as a leader.

Even when subordinates aren’t following up on the plan, or making an expected blunder, leaders exercising Extreme Ownership cannot blame them. Because the leader was responsible to make sure they understood the plan fully and were fully trained for carrying on their tasks flawlessly.
—The leader must take care that **everyone in the team can get the job done.**

If there are underperformers, it’s *your responsibility* to bring them up to par. And if the underperformer cannot meet standards, it’s your team, so it’s up to you to get on board **someone who can do the job.**  
Because at the end of the day, the leader **must be loyal to the team and the mission,** *not to any single individual.*

The leaders must look at an organization’s problems with **the objective in mind** and *without any emotional attachments.*


## Chapter 2: No bad teams, only bad leaders.

The precept that there are no bad teams, only bad leaders, is a big recurring theme in Extreme Ownership by Jocko Willink.

And when it comes to demanding a high standard of performance, **it’s not about what you preach, but what you tolerate.**

Another key to excellent performance is **embedding Extreme Ownership at every level** into the team. Everyone must feel Extreme Ownership of their tasks and duties, no matter if people around you fail to deliver their part.

-   Leadership is the single greatest factor in any teams performance.
- Think about the story of the CTO who wouldn’t accept ownership. The CEO was allowing substandard performance from his CTO, and his CTO wouldn’t accept ownership. Which in turn had a trickle-down effect on the other employees in his company.

## Chapter 3 : Believe

A leader must truly fully believe in the mission to convince and inspire his team.

If he doesn’t fully believe in the mission, a leader must work within himself to align with the thoughts and vision of the mission.

**Aggressive and proactive** 
Jocko explains that, as a leader, your default setting should be **aggressive – proactive** rather than reactive. This is critical to the success of any team. Instead of letting the situation dictate our decisions, **we must dictate the situation.**

-  The leader must **ask the question of why?** Why are we being asked to do this? If they don’t understand, then they **must** ask questions to the people that are higher on the chain to understand why. Otherwise, you will have a hard time convinicing your own subordinates.
- There are no stupid questions, ignorance is the catalyst to learning.
-  Leadership takes courage to ask questions that make you feel stupid.

## Chapter 4 : EGO

Ego is a **big threat** to top performance. And the most challenging ego to deal with, is your own. **Be confident, not cocky**.

-   Everyone has an ego. It drives the most successful people in life, but when it clouds our judgement, then ego becomes destructive.
- Remember, it's about the mission and *the best way* to accomplish it.

# **Part II: The Laws of Combat**
## Chapter 5: Cover and Move

Cover and Move is the most fundamental tactic.  
And **cover and move means teamwork**.
You are only as strong as your weakest link is applicable here.

All elements within the greater team are fundamental and must mutually support each other and work together to achieve the final goal.

-   You have to get rid of the “Us vs Them” mentality

Leaders have the responsibility to link between the tactical and strategic perspectives.  
It’s up to leaders to remind and explain how the team fits in the greater strategical mission and what’s their part in it to achieve that mission.


## Chapter 6: Simple

Simplicity is **key** to success.

Always simplify as much as possible.  
People will not understand complicated plans and orders and complexity compounds issues when things go wrong -and they will-.  
Communicate plans and order simply, clearly, and concisely.

And if your team doesn’t get it, again, **it’s your fault**. You must be clear enough to ensure **everyone** in the team understands.

-   You must brief so that the **lowest common denominator** can understand. Make sure that people **can ask questions** when they **don’t understand** what the key parts of the mission are.


## Chapter 7: Prioritize and Execute

Dealing with too many tasks at a time is impossible and will make you fail.  
**Take a breath, step back for a second, prioritize and execute**. Then deal with the next item on the list.

Prioritize and execute is your guiding principle at any time the situation is getting overwhelming and out of hand.

-   If your team understands where the priorities are, then they can execute without specific direction from you.

Contingency planning can be of great help here to stay a step ahead of real-time problems.  
This is because a good contingency plan will force you to look into likely challenges and instead of being caught in the heat of the moment, you will execute a few already thought-through effective responses.

Order of Process
1.   Evaluate the highest priority problem
2.   Lay out in **simple**, clear, and concise terms the highest priority effort for your team
3.   Develop and determine the solution
4.  Seek input from key leaders, and from the team where possible
5.  Direct the execution focusing all efforts and resources to this priority task
6.  Move on to the next priority problem
7.  Repeat


## Chapter 8 : Decentralized command

Humans generally cannot manage more than **six to ten** people effectively, and that’s all the truer when things start going wrong.  
Hence there must a leader for each team of 4 to 5 people.

Expect and empower those leaders both below and around you to make decisions and make a good job.

They should not be asking you what to do but tell you what they are going to do.
-   The leaders must know that they are empowered to make decisions and that their leaders will **back them up.**

-   Leaders must be able to **trust** their subordinate leaders to take charge of the smaller teams within the team and allow them to execute based on a good understanding of the broader mission and standard operating procedures, and allow adjustments when nessacery.

Explaining to each tactical operator the overarching tactical goals, the why you’re doing something, is key: the people who were the least engaged, the biggest complainers and often lowest performers were the ones who didn’t take any part in drafting the plan of actions.

> [!note] Leadership positions
> - If the Leader/Jr. Leader is too far in the front , They are too caught up in the action and won't be able to properly manage or lead a team.
> - If the Leader/Jr. Leader is too far back then she is playing clean-up duty and wont be in enough of the action to care or even be congnizant of what is going on.
> - This is why in Valorant you dont want to be the **entry fragger** because your too far **into the action** to be an effective leader but you also dont want to be a **Sentinel** because you are **too far back** (watching flank) to understand whats going on in the front lines. 
> That is why being a Controller or third man in is the best choice to be a Leader


# **Part III: Sustaining Victory**

## Chapter 9: Plan

-  Never take anything for granted, prepare for likely contingencies, and maximizing the chance of mission success while minimizing the risk.
- Utilize all assets and lean on any subordinate leaders with better intelligence on a given situation. Leaders know when to delegate.
-    Planning begins with mission analysis. Leaders must identify clear directives for the team.
-  The plan must describe the overall purpose of the mission. The front line troops must understand the intent of the mission, and where it fits into the big picture and also where they fit in that plan.
- The best teams take time for analysis **after a mission is over.** This is to discuss **lessons learned** and how to better plan the next mission. (Post Operational De-brief)
-  A leader’s checklist for planning should include the following:
    -   Analyze the mission. 
    -   Understand higher headquarters mission.
    -   Identify and state your own commander’s intent.
    -   Identify personnel, assets, time, and resources available.
    -   Decentralize the planning process. Empower junior leaders to analyze possible courses of action.
    -   Determine a specific course of action.
    -   Lean towards selecting the most simple course of action.
    -   Empower key leaders to develop the plan for the selected course of action.
    -   Plan for likely contingencies through each phase and mitigate risk where possible. 
    -   Delegate portions of the plan to key junior leaders.
    -   Stand back and be the tactical genius.
    -   Continually check and question the plan against emerging information.
    -   Brief the plan to all participants and supporting assets. Emphasize commander’s intent. Ask questions and engage in discussion and interaction with the team to insure they understand.
    -   Conduct post operational debrief after execution. Take note of lessons learned and implement them in future planning.
-    The only thing that matters in a good brief is if the front line people understand what they need to know.
    -   Brief to the lowest common denominator. The dumbest dude.
-   As a leader, if you are down in the weeds trying to plan with the front line crew then you will not be able to see the entire plan.
	-    You need to let the front lines **create their own plan** after you give them the broader view. Trust in the **foundation information** that you gave, and that they **understand the plan** enough to **make** **adjustments**.

## Chapter 10: Leading Up and Down

A leader takes responsibility for leading not just for his subordinates, but also his superiors.  
It means you push up situational awareness to your superior and take care of obtaining all the support you need to enable your team to accomplish the mission.

**Leading down:**
-   It is difficult for people who are entrenched in the minutia of what they are doing to understand the bigger picture, but it is crucial to the success and wellbeing of your subordinates to have them understand the big picture.
- Explain how your Jr leader's goals contribute to the bigger success.
- Observe front line troops to understand from their perspective and use that to help explain the bigger goal.


If your bosses are asking many questions before you are allowed to do anything, then you aren’t doing a good enough job explaining your plans to them.
-   You need to lead your bosses by doing better yourself.


If someone isn’t doing what you want them to do, look at yourself first and see what you are not doing best.  
-   Take responsibility for leading everyone in your world. Your superiors and subordinates alike.

You should know your job so well that you don’t ask your leader what you should do but you tell them what you are going to do.
-   **Don’t ask your leader what you should do, tell them what you are going to do.**

> [!note] Sidebar
> When you are mad or frustrated at someone , ask yourself what you could've done to make the situation better.
> Don't blame the person, figure out what YOU can do to inform the person properly to WIN.



## Chapter 11 – Decisiveness amid uncertainty

-   You must know the impact of your decision. Whether they can be reversed or altered.
- nothing can truly capture the pressure from uncertainty, chaos, and the element of the unknown until you are in the middle of the mission.
    -   The answers are almost never immediately obvious.
-   There is no 100% right solution. Leaders must be comfortable with this, and make decisions promptly. Then, as things unfold, change path if needed.
- Waiting for the 100% right and certain solution will take too long, and you can miss your opportunity.
-   As a leader, your default setting should be aggressive and proactive. Not reactive.

## Chapter 12 – Discipline = Freedom, the Dichotomy of leadership

**-   Discipline starts every day when the first alarm clock goes off every morning.
    -   Have 3 alarms set. One battery powered. One electric. One wind up.
    -   This is the first test. It sets the tone for the rest of the day.
    -   If you have the discipline to get out of bed, you win.
    -   If you are mentally weak for that moment and you let the weakness keep you in bed, you fail.
    -   If you want extra time, you have to make extra time. You do this by getting up early.**

**-   The more disciplined you are, the more freedom you have to practice decentralized command.**

The characteristics of a good leader are:

-   Confident but not arrogant;
-   Brave but not daredevil;
-   Strive to win but gracious in loss
-   Detail oriented but not obsessive;
-   A leader but also a follower when needed;
-   Quiet but not always silent;
-   Logical but not without emotions
-   Close with the soldiers, but nobody is more important than another or of the team as a whole;
-   Not so chummy they forget who’s the leader;
-   Takes Extreme Ownership, and exercises Decentralized Command;
-   Has nothing to prove and everything to prove at the same time
