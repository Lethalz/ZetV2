Beyond Order by Jordan Peterson

## Takeaway

- The purpose of a game isn’t to win it. It’s to play in a way that people want to keep playing with you.
- Heroes are the people that establish order in utter chaos.
- Freud believed that all mental illnesses were due to repression.
- The price paid for refusing to know what we should know is purposelessness.
- If you have a goal, you may fail. But if you don’t have any, you will fail.
- Refusing to know prevents you from moving forward.
- If you want to be invaluable, do the useful things no one else wants to do.
- You grow up when you take on more responsibility.
- The nature of mankind isn’t to coward in front of the monster, but to fight it when necessary.
- Anything sufficiently threatful cannot be forgotten if it is not understood.
- Being single leads to a feeling of incompletion.

## What _Beyond Order_ Talks About

[_Beyond Order_](https://amzn.to/3JScSnq) is a book written by Jordan Peterson. It seeks to take readers beyond the idea of transforming chaos into order. It addresses themes like excessive order, pain, grief, coping and nihilism. The author draws on psychology, religion, and ethics to propose a way to react when life becomes difficult.

Jesus.

It was not an easy read. There were one or two things ([Rule III](about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Fauresnotes.com%2Fsummary-beyond-order-jordan-peterson%2F#3), [Rule IV](about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Fauresnotes.com%2Fsummary-beyond-order-jordan-peterson%2F#4), [Rule IX](about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Fauresnotes.com%2Fsummary-beyond-order-jordan-peterson%2F#9)) I appreciated in this book, such as Peterson’s insistence on responsibility.

Unfortunately, many things were a simple repeat of _[12 Rules for Life](https://auresnotes.com/summary-12-rules-for-life-jordan-peterson/)_ (such as the two last chapters), other things were repeated throughout the book (potential, sins of commission and omission, which also were in _12 Rules for Life)_ and others were just laughable ([Rule X](about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Fauresnotes.com%2Fsummary-beyond-order-jordan-peterson%2F#10)).

Overall, I am a little disappointed with _Beyond Order_.

I don’t think you should read it if you’ve read _12 Rules for Life_ as you won’t learn much. You better go find another author and read what they have to say about these questions.

8/10.

## Short Summary of _Beyond Order_

**Do not carelessly denigrate social institutions or creative achievement**. Institutions have evolved with rules that enabled the flourishment of society. Without these rules, society wouldn’t be as good as it is. However, the rules established in the past to solve the problems of the past, sometimes, do no longer suit the present or future. In that case, they should be changed. Institutions keep what should be kept. Creative endeavor changes what should be changed. Don’t denigrate any of them.

**Imagine who you could be, and then aim single-mindedly at that**. You have tremendous potential, that potential is the Materia Prima. It is everything you could be. You become who you need to by going on an adventure, by being the hero. Heroes often become heroes by establishing order where there is too much chaos. The adventure you go on is informed by a purpose you need to have. That purpose is your future. To determine your future, you should understand where you came from, and where you are now.

**Do not hide unwanted things in the fog**. We hide things in the fog because the act of knowing hurt us in the past. It’s easy not to know. Ignorance is bliss. But the cost to pay is purposelessness. When you refuse to know, you refuse to see what’s broken, so you can’t repair it, so you can’t move forward. This leads to anxiety and depression. If you keep too much junk in your closet, and never sort it out, your closet at some point, will explode. But will you have the strength to sort it out then?

**Notice that opportunity lurks where responsibility has been abdicated**. Important people do important things, and they are important because they are responsible for these things. When responsibility has been abdicated somewhere, it means a place got free for whoever wants to become important. Responsibility is how you grow. The more you have it, the more you grow. The amount of responsibility you should take on is equal to the size of the biggest goal you are capable to achieve.

**Do not do what you hate**. Do not do what you know is morally wrong. If you do, when will you stop? If you don’t voice your disapproval, when will you? Will you have the courage to do it then?

**Abandon ideology**. Ideology is a mental escape door enabling a loser to blame their loss on an “enemy” or a system. The ideology creates an ideological lens that greatly simplifies the world. Simple principles are derived to explain _how the world works_ and what are the things that can be done to _solve it all._ Ideology isn’t reality, and it won’t help you solve your problems because “the system” isn’t responsible for them: it’s you. Lead the fight within yourself and solve your own problems this way, before you try to change the world.

**Work as hard as you possibly can on at least one thing and see what happens.** Heat and pressure transform coal into diamond the same way a goal will make you be one with yourself. A goal means you need to commit to something, which is good because it creates certainty and a clear purpose. This makes you happy. Not having any goals, or too many, will make you feel lost.

**Try to make one room in your home as beautiful as possible**. When you do so, you establish a relationship with the transcendent by creating something where there used to be nothing. But beware! When you stick your neck out, people will try to bring you down.

**If old memories still upset you, write them down carefully and completely.** The past is a source of knowledge you can use to behave better in the future. If the past does not leave you alone, if memories often come back, it means your emotional system knows you didn’t learn your lesson, and comes knocking to make sure that you do. You need to understand why the things happened happened to integrate your lesson and adapt your behavior in consequence of that. Writing helps you understand and meditate on these mistakes so you can change accordingly and avoid running into such a situation in the future.

**Plan and work diligently to maintain the romance in your relationship.** You want and need a relationship, as there is a feeling of incompletion if you remain single. Once you have a relationship, you will have to work hard to make it work as it is not easy. This pressure to make it work no matter what is provided by marriage. Marriage is a threat that really means “we’re not getting rid of each other”. Define what you want out of the relationship, and make sure every mundane thing is taken care of. Define the role of each one. And finally, once it’s done, you have time for sex. Define when you have it, and make efforts to keep the romance in it.

**Do not allow yourself to become resentful, deceitful, or arrogant.** It leads you to do things like lying, or hurting, which you shouldn’t do. When you lie, you transform truth and impact your instinct that helps you orientate yourself in the world. When you deceive, you manipulate reality because you think that version is better than the real version. When you are arrogant, you can find excuses to do such things. When you’re resentful, you believe fairness gives you the right to hit back. So don’t become any of these things. It will prevent you from doing stuff you’ll regret later.

**Be grateful in spite of your suffering.** Whether you believe it or not, you have the tools to confront your suffering and transcend it. You can make things better. When you suffer and triumph, you become stronger and happier. Suffering isn’t nice, but if you react well in the face of adversity, it will improve your life in the long term. So be grateful for that. You can’t know how much you have…until you lose it all.

## Summary of _Beyond Order_ Written by Jordan Peterson

## **Overture**

Why _Beyond Order_? Order is known territory. It’s safe. However, life isn’t always safe and stable – and you don’t want it to be.

When disorder hits though, it can be too strong. As a result, we risk imposing authoritarianism as we strive to control something we cannot.

This isn’t good either.

So the only thing left is to dive into the chaos head first and see what we can make out of it.

You don’t want too much, and you don’t want too much order. There is a need for balance.

While _[12 Rules for Life](https://auresnotes.com/summary-12-rules-for-life-jordan-peterson/)_ dealt with establishing order, _Beyond Order_ warns against too much order.

To move forward in life, we need to keep one foot in order, and one _beyond_ so we can grow and explore unknown territory.

## Rule I: Do Not Carelessly Denigrate Social Institutions or Creative Achievement

### **Loneliness and Confusion**

**Conversation helps keep our minds organized**.

We all need to think, and we think by talking. We can’t think alone in a room. This is why we need other people around us.

### **Sanity as a Social Institution**

For Jung and Freud, sanity happened when the different identities were in sync with each other.

- The id (the instinct)
- The superego (the idea we have of social order)
- The ego (the “I”)

These three components are kept “in check” by other people.

![image 10](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20768%20290'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

> People remain mentally healthy not merely because of the integrity of their own minds, but because they are constantly being reminded how to think, act, and speak by those around them.

If you start behaving weirdly, people will make you notice so you behave normally again.

But how do we develop a consensus on what is _normal_ (what we should do), and what isn’t (what we should not do)?

That depends on what we respectively value.

### **The Point of Pointing**

> If you are not communicating about anything that engages other people, then the value of your communication—even the value of your very presence—risks falling to zero.

What should we point towards? We need food, water, clean air, shelter, companionship, play, touch, and intimacy. Ideally, we should focus on the things that will help us acquire these in a socially acceptable manner.

Whatever you value, it must also be good for other people, not just for you, as you need other people to acquire it.

These constraints limit the number of problems there are in life and the number of solutions to solve them.

> The fact of limited solutions implies the existence of something like a natural ethic—variable, perhaps, as human languages are variable, but still characterized by something solid and universally recognizable at its base.

Institutions have evolved to try to serve these problems in the best way they can. This is why denigrating them is dangerous.

### **Bottom Up**

Everyone agrees (more or less) on what has worth and what doesn’t. This consensus has been developing for hundreds of millions of years.

_How should you act_ actually is _how should you survive,_ since that’s what life is really about.

To answer this question, we need to go back into the past and have a look at what’s important.

A very simple living organism reacts with A when faced with stimulus A, and reacts with B when faced with stimulus B.

As the complexity of beings increases, they can react with A, B, C…until Z when faced with stimulus A.

![image 7](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20512%20295'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

As the complexity of beings increases, they can react with A, B, C…until Z when faced with stimulus A.

By the age of two, a child can already use all of his senses to orientate himself. He can play with other toddlers.

> The universal rules of fair play include the ability to regulate emotion and motivation while cooperating and competing in pursuit of the goal during the game (that is part and parcel of being able to play at all), as well as the ability and will to establish reciprocally beneficial interactions across time and situation.

The purpose of a game isn’t to win it. **It’s to play it again** with the same people. **The purpose is to keep collaboration across time.**

How do you do so?

### **The Utility of the Fool**

Being at the bottom of a hierarchy helps you develop gratitude and humility. Humility means that it’s better to assume ignorance than certainty. This is why you should make friends with people that know stuff you don’t.

In the Tarot card, there is a fool that climbs a mountain, only to fall down and do it again. The Fool isn’t dumb – he’s wise. It’s good to remain a fool, to remain a beginner, because it helps you get started with doing things.

**It’s good not to know, as it compels the pursuit of knowledge.**

### **The Necessity of Equals**

Children with no friends are more likely to be depressive, anxious, or antisocial, and children with few friends are more likely to be unemployed and unmarried as adults.

The importance of friendship does not decline in adulthood.

People that live longer seem to be living longer due to their social networks.

### **Top Dog**

People are fragile, and as a result, life is suffering. In order to alleviate this suffering, people must work together (to provide food, water, shelter, etc).

When this happens, people that know how to reach the common goal lead those that don’t. A hierarchy must be established, and it’s established based on **competence**.

If you’re good at what you do, you should be at the top. People at the top don’t necessarily have power. They have authority.

Ambition is often mistaken for the desire for power. But power and authority are different.

**Power is coercing someone into doing something with threats. Authority is having people genuinely following you because they know you’re the best.**

Those hungry for power desire control. The ambitious ones desire authority because they want to solve a specific problem.

Sometimes, authority and power go hand in hand, but authority constraints power.

### **Social Institutions Are Necessary – But Insufficient**

> Sanity is knowing the rules of the social game, internalizing them, and following them. Differences in status are therefore inevitable, as all worthwhile endeavors have a goal, and those who pursue them have different abilities in relationship to that goal.

One should accept these differences and keep on moving forward.

Why are social institutions insufficient? Because the solutions we found yesterday and today to solve our problems are not necessarily the solutions we will need for tomorrow. Rules and institutions need to evolve with the world.

You should comply with institutional rules most of the time. You should stop complying when they become archaic, pathological, or corrupt.

The question is: when do we know when we should stop complying?

It depends on people. Some are pre-disposed to follow, others are pre-disposed to rebel. People on the right are pre-disposed to keep the structure as it is. People on the left are pre-disposed to change it.

Both of them will be right at some point. Institutions should not be changed when functional, but they definitely should when they’re not.

### **The Necessity of Balance**

The conservative approach helps a society practice what has always worked while a liberal approach helps with getting rid of what no longer works.

You need both conservative and liberal approaches.

Good leaders are equally able to work with both. They are people that can see what needs to be kept, and what needs to be changed.

### **Personality as Hierarchy – and Capacity for Transformation**

> How, then, is the personality that balances respect for social institutions and, equally, creative transformation to be understood?

It’s a difficult question, so we use stories to help us understand. Stories contain overarching principles about how we should act. Their simple form enables us to remember the principles.

In the end, we see that the ideal personality is the one that can both be conservative and transformative.

Why? Because not all rules are good to follow, and not all rules are good to follow in all situations.

Eg: In Harry Potter, the three heroes can learn new stuff and follow the rules of the school…until these rules force them to commit actions whose initial rules had been made to prevent.

As a result, this is why you need both conservatism and creative transformation.

Respect the rules, except when those rules disregard an even higher moral principle.

The relation between social institutions and creative achievement maintains this balance.

Do not carelessly denigrate social institutions or creative achievement.

---

## Rule II: Imagine Who You Could Be, and Then Aim Single-Mindedly at That

### **Who Are You – And Who Could You Be?**

Nothing is more complex than a human being, and the complexity of who you are is reinforced by who you could be.

**Everyone knows they could be more than they are.** This potential sometimes fails to realize due to poor health or other tragedies…but also due to the unwillingness to seize opportunities.

This complexity was embedded into the stories from Antiquity that we still tell today (Greek tragedies, the Bible, etc).

Socrates believed that learning was remembering. He believed that our soul knew everything but forgot it upon being born. By experiencing life, we could (re)discover what we didn’t know we had forgotten.

> Stories become unforgettable when they communicate sophisticated modes of being—complex problems and equally complex solutions—that we perceive, consciously, in pieces, but cannot fully articulate.

### **The Emergence of the Unfortunate**

How does a remarkable story emerge? First, what is a remarkable story?

> An unforgettable story captures the essence of humanity and distills, communicates, and clarifies it, bringing what we are and what we should be into focus.

A story is a sum of principles one should observe in a certain situation. These principles are validated by time (it is their repetition through time that validates them). As a result, **a remarkable story is something that takes time to make.**

These stories speak to us and motivate us, they make us want to be like the hero.

So, the answer to “who are you” is:

- Part of yourself that voluntarily explores the unknown.
- Part of yourself that is evil and dangerous (the “monster”).
- Part of yourself that turns too much order into chaos or too much chaos into order.

### **Materia Prima: Who You Could Be (I)**



Materia Prima: Inspired by Hermes Trismegistus, Occulta philosophia (1613). Also from H. Nollius, Theoria philosophiae hermeticae

The author subsequently explains the image above. This image was made by an alchemist.

The Materia Prima (first matter in Latin) was thought to be the basic substance from which everything else emerged.

That Materia Prima is what we feel when we consider what we could become in the future.

![image 8](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20471%20295'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

The Materia Prima.

It can also be all of the information we will use to build our future selves.

What’s this potential (or information)? It can manifest itself with a letter saying you owe a lot of money to the tax authorities.

It can also be the same letter, but saying you got into your dream university.

Whatever the letter says, you need to decide: are you going to act on it, or ignore it?

Everyone was at some point fascinated with something. We didn’t choose that thing – that thing chose us.

When you follow that thing, it leads you somewhere, to another thing, then to another thing, etc.

It’s not easy, but it’s an adventure. That adventure is informative, and informs the person you’re going to be. It’s building up your potential.

### **Polytheism Into Monotheis, and the Emergence of the Virtuous Hero: Who You Could Be (II)**

Let’s explore the “who you could be” from another perspective.

The Mesopotamians had the following story.

One day, Apsu, the god of order, was killed. Enraged, his wife, Tiamat, the goddess of chaos, waged war against the other gods. All of them failed to beat her. Marduk, a young god, offered to fight her, but asks to reign over the cosmos if he wins. He wins, and becomes king, holding the Tablet of Destiny.

This story shows how chaos unleashes when order is destroyed, and how order can be put back thanks to a hero.

### **How to Act**

As humans, we first learn by mimicking people older than us. Later on, religions came to tell us how to act.

Those that could observe the rules well enough often ended up breaking them as well, often for a higher moral purpose (as we discussed in Rule I).

What does this mean?

That you need to have a purpose. You need to know where you are going. For that, you need to know where you were in the past and where you are now – or you’ll drown in uncertainty.

Don’t avoid the obstacles on your path. If you switch paths, make sure you really switch – and not give up your path for an easier path.

Imagine who you could be, and then aim single-mindedly at that.


## Rule III: Do Not Hide Unwanted Things in the Fog

### **Those Damned Plates**

One small annoying thing in your life (or relationship) isn’t a problem.

But hundreds, or thousands of them, eventually make you unhappy.

When you don’t like something, say it. Have the fight about it _now_. Don’t wait, as it will make it worse.

### **Corruption: Commission and Omission**

People that never voice their disagreement deceive. They deceive others, but they also deceive themselves.

Self-deception is from a logical perspective, impossible (you should not be able to deceive yourself because you know you are doing it).

But the human mind can actually hold simultaneously two contradictive ideas.

Freud believed that all mental illnesses were due to repression (which is a form of self-deception).

Other phenomena are:

- Denial
- Reaction formation
- Displacement
- Identification
- Rationalization
- Intellectualization
- Sublimation
- Projection

Freud made two mistakes.

1. He listed only sins of commission (stuff people do) and missed the sins of omission (stuff they _don’t_ do) while the latter also cause mental illness. And they also can be grave. Eg: if, as a CEO, you think your accountant is crooked and you do not investigate because you’d rather not know, you could end up in prison.
2. Freud thought that we understood the things we experienced. He thought that memory was an objective record of the past (while human memory can be falsifiable). But it’s not. Eg: if you ask a couple what happened after a fight, you’ll get two different versions.

### **What Is the Fog**

The knowledge you’ve gained since you were a kid has led to more disappointment than positive surprises.

You thought the world was all good and fluffy, and realized it is dark and mean (in part).

Maybe up to a point where you’ve had your world shattered several times.

So, why go through more disappointments? The last thing you want is to know more. **Ignorance is bliss**, isn’t it?!

Imagine you’re so afraid of reality that you don’t even want to know what it is that you _really_ want. If you knew, you could hope to have it. But if you had hopes, they could also be shattered (again). Or you could fail. And you’d fail, you’d know it’d be your fault.

Do you want to live with it? No. So you hide. You refuse to see and learn.

The fog is the refusal to know.

When you articulate an emotion that has been repressed for a long time, you often cry. Who wants to do that? It’s better to leave things buried deep.

When your spouse makes an assertion very close to the truth, you often answer with a sharp insult. This insult is an obstacle that in fact, invites the spouse to keep digging. If he/she does not, the insulter often feels even lonelier and disappointed.

People hiding things in the fog pursue the following strategies.

- They show disappointment when someone makes them unhappy.
- They resent others when something does not go their way.
- They ensure that whoever said a bit too much is kept at bay and frozen by disproval.
- Not communicating about what others have done to disappoint them and force them to find that out themselves.
- They let others wander in the fog they have created.

The advantage of the fog may be comfort. But the price paid is purposelessness. Lack of purpose furthermore, creates:

- Chronic pain
- Overwhelming anxiety
- Intolerable chaos of unexploited possibility
- Too much choice

If you have a goal, you may fail. But if you don’t have any, you **will** fail.

So, what’s the alternative?

Dissipate the fog. Learn what you are afraid of. Admit what you refuse to admit.

It’s not easy. It can be embarrassing, and worse, it can be misplaced too (whatever you think about a problem may not be so. Eg: you think your spouse cheated, but they didn’t).

Admission and transparency demand trust. It’s not easy to trust because everyone has (been) betrayed. It’s hard to have faith in humanity, **which is why trust should not be based on faith, but on courage.**

Trusting is not saying “I know I can trust you” but saying “I will trust you despite the chance you can betray me”.

What does it mean in practice?

It means not asking your spouse “why are you ignoring me?”

It is stating “I feel lonely without your attention”.

### **Events and Memories**

The past isn’t a database we can just use at will. It needs to be refined. We don’t only want to know what happened, but **why it happened.**

It’s difficult, and it almost guarantees that in order to make _why_ useful, you’ll have to change. You’ll have to change to avoid repeating the mistakes you have made, or to do better.

The refusal to understand the past leaves you empty and confused. It leaves you ignorant, as you refuse to expand your consciousness.

If too much junk accumulates in your closet, it will inevitably explode at some point. At that time, you may not have enough energy or time to sort it out (this is the return of Tiamat).

There may be times when you will be able to open the door you need to open and understand what you need to understand. But there will be times when doing so will take everything you have got.

Do not hide unwanted things in the fog.

## Rule IV: Note That Opportunity Lurks Where Responsibility Has Been Abdicated

### **Make Yourself Invaluable**

If you want to be invaluable, do the useful things no one else wants to do (in the workplace, for example).

No need to start with “a lot”. Start with one thing you can do, and grow from there. It sounds painful at first, but you grow up when you take care of more important stuff.

This is good!

> It appears that the meaning that most effectively sustains life is to be found in the adoption of responsibility.

We’re always happy to look back on the difficult things we’ve done. No one has ever had great satisfaction with doing something easy. **Difficulty is necessary.**

This is why games have rules. It wouldn’t be fun if there weren’t any.

### **Responsibility and Meaning**

**Overall, people are more upset by the things they haven’t done than by the things they did.** Not growing up, like Peter Pan, is missing out on life.

In the story, Abraham only began living at 75. He then encountered famine, tyranny, conflict, and childlessness.

What’s the message? That it is those who see and hear what others don’t who become heroes. These are the ones that save the princess, kill the dragon, or rescue his father from the belly of the beast.

### **Rescue Your Father: Orisis and Horus**

Osiris, the god of order and consciousness, was the original god in Egypt. As time passed, he aged and stopped paying attention. His evil brother Set got out of nowhere, dismembered him (you can’t kill Osiris), and spread the limbs over Egypt.

The goddess Isis then left the underworld and looked for Osiris. She only found his d*ck (true story). So she made herself pregnant with it and went back to the underworld where she gave birth to Horus.

Horus had one gift: his eye. He not only could see, but he also **wanted** to.

Horus left the underworld and confronted Set. Set tore one of Horus’ eyes, but Horus won the fight. He banished Set (you can’t kill him) and took back his eye.

After that, he went into the underworld to find Osiris, and gave him his eye. Together, they ruled over Egypt.

What’s the meaning? When you stop paying attention because your life is in order, the chaos can come pretty quickly and completely unravel your life. You need to look at things for what they really are and be courageous enough to fight evil to reestablish order.

Don’t lose sight of what matters, don’t sleep. Remain vigilant, and be brave enough to see even what you don’t want to see.

Neither Osiris nor Set can be killed, because chaos and order will always exist.

It is the alliance of wisdom and attention that helps a pharaoh rule Egypt.

When you look at new information, you look at who you could be. It’s the eternal human question.

When you look in the abyss, you see a monster. The further the abyss is, the more monstrous the monster is.

The nature of mankind isn’t to coward in front of the monster, but to fight it when necessary. That was the nature of our ancestors who were explorers, adventurers, founders of cities. These are the ancestors that you can become.

That ancestor is hidden in the deepest possible place, which is where you have to go if you want to be like him.

### **And Who Might That Be?**

Let’s assume you have a moral obligation to take care of “at least” yourself. What does that mean? Doing whatever you want as if there were no tomorrow?

No, because you know tomorrow is coming and that all bills come due at some point.

**Since you need to take care of yourself, you already have social responsibility: yourself.**

The “you” you are taking care of exists across time. So, doing stuff that will have bad consequences is selfishness for _you now_, and a lack of care for _you later_.

In a way, how you should treat yourself = how you treat other people, since yourself in the future _is_ somebody else.

### **Happiness and Responsibility**

Everyone wants to be happy, but that doesn’t mean you should seek happiness. Happiness is an instantaneous thing. People only think about _now_ when they’re happy and they become impulsive.

So, what else is there? Living with a sense of responsibility, to yourself, and (maybe) to a higher moral imperative, such as the responsibility to positively impact your life **and** the life of others.

What would be the consequences of that?

You feel positive emotions: the most powerful positive emotions come from going after a meaningful goal.

What does that mean?

That you can’t be happy without taking responsibility for **at least** yourself. Giving up on your goal is giving up on your responsibility, and that makes your life depressive.

Aiming at a lesser goal will make you ashamed and not motivated.

> I have never met anyone who was satisfied when they knew they were not doing everything they should be doing.

You can’t escape the future, and you know it.

### **Pick Up the Extra Weight**

There is a proper way to behave. That way is the way that has been working for everyone, forever.

Being is a game. Great players are attractive. They attract mates. The playing field selects the best players based on their ethical behavior.

You want to be the best player, so you imitate the best ethical behavior. When you do something opposed to your principles, you frown. You know you’ve betrayed yourself. When you’re not following the right path, you know.

And you know that at some point, you’ll pay the price.

> If the cost of betraying yourself, in the deepest sense, is guilt, shame, and anxiety, the benefit of not betraying yourself is meaning—the meaning that sustains. That is the most valuable of opportunities that lurks where responsibility has been abdicated

If you pay attention, you will notice that your conscious will quickly tell you what’s wrong. If you stop doing it, you’ll naturally start doing what’s right.

Slowly but surely, you will live “in accordance with yourself”.

> What is the antidote to the suffering and malevolence of life? The highest possible goal. What is the prerequisite to pursuit of the highest possible goal? Willingness to adopt the maximum degree of responsibility—and this includes the responsibilities that others disregard or neglect.

You may ask, “why would I want this burden?”

But what makes you think you do not want it?

> You positively need to be occupied with something weighty, deep, profound, and difficult. Then, when you wake up in the middle of the night and the doubts crowd in, you have some defense: “For all my flaws, which are manifold, at least I am doing this. At least I am taking care of myself. At least I am of use to my family, and to the other people around me. At least I am moving, stumbling upward, under the load I have determined to carry.”

> Your life becomes meaningful in precise proportion to the depths of the responsibility you are willing to shoulder

![image](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20551%20301'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

The relationship between responsibility and meaningfulness.

That’s because you are actively working at making things better.

As you go in that direction, a sense of meaning will develop.

Meaning is an indication you are on the right path.

We’re all possessed by an inner instinct to make us do the highest good. This is why people disappoint you and why you lose connection. However, these disappointments are signs of a lack of responsibility.

When you’re angry at your boss for a lack of something, that anger signifies that the way things _ought to be_ is not the way _things are._ It’s an invitation to **you** to make them **how they ought to be.** It’s an invitation to take responsibility for something that no one is taking responsibility for.

Notice that opportunity lurks where responsibility has been abdicated.

## Rule V: Do Not Do What You Hate

### **Pathological Order in Its Day-to-Day Guise**

The author tells the story of a client of his rising up against w0k€n€$$ in her company due to her opposition to the ideology.

To do so, she had to become courageous, face social pressure, a career risk, and that made her stronger.

Few people would do this. Few stand up against what they believe is morally wrong. But if you’re not standing up now, when will you do so?

And why do you think you will not participate in the transgressions when they get out of hand?

> Part of moving Beyond Order is knowing when you have such a reason. Part of moving Beyond Order is understanding that your conscience has a primary claim on your action, which supersedes your conventional social duty.

When you refuse to comply with something you believe is morally wrong, _you can be part of the force of truth that brings corruption and tyranny to a halt._

It is the one conscious individual that prevents the group from becoming insane.

### **Fortify Your Position**

> When culture disintegrates—because it refuses to be aware of its own pathology; because the visionary hero is absent—it descends into the chaos that underlies everything.

Under such condition, an individual must seek the truthful principles that make life worth living, or drown in an ocean of despair, corruption, and nihilism.

You can’t do things you hate if you want to be a part of a great project. You must fortify your positions.

Otherwise, you become a puppet, and you live with the knowledge that you are responsible.

We’re not hopeless. Your enemy, as big as he is, may not be as strong as you think it is. And you are not as weak as you think you are either.

### **Practicalities**

If you can’t stand your job, change it. Move. It’s tough, but it’s the best solution as the alternative is to have your own soul destroyed.

---

## Rule VI: Abandon Ideology

### **Abandon Ideology**

We have failed these last 50 or so years to teach responsibilities because we focused too much on rights.

As a result, young people ignore that meaning is found in the burden of responsibility. They look in the wrong places for it, fail to find it, and are seduced by easy answers.

### **Perhaps He Is Only Sleeping**

Nietzsche proclaimed that rationality had killed religion and the bulk of values Western society had been built on, and that there were only two possible outcomes to that situation. First, political totalitarianism would occupy the vacuum left by God (he was right).

Second, in an objective and valueless world, a man (the superman) would make up his own values and project them onto the world (he was also right).

Freud and Jung said we weren’t good enough to create our own values by ourselves out of nowhere (at an individual level). Furthermore, a society where each individual would have their own values would be assembled by nothing.

But values, even when shared by everyone, are not objective, and religious experience is purely subjective too. So how can they gather people?

Well…it seems that religious revelations to individuals inspired them to assemble around these revelations.

We’re in a territory moving beyond objectivity and subjectivity.

As a result, the idea that values aren’t real may actually be false: values are so complicated that they can’t be explained scientifically.

But the fact that religious values can unite different people under a single umbrella means that the possibility for something _universal_ exists.

Yet we all assume that it doesn’t.

### **The Fatal Attraction of the False Idol**

Consider conservatives, feminists, environmentalists, socialists, etc. Fundamentally, these ideologies are religions with one or several gods.

> These gods are the axioms and foundational beliefs that must be accepted, a priori, rather than proven, before the belief system can be adopted, and when accepted and applied to the world allow the illusion to prevail that knowledge has been produced.

Here’s how these ideologies are created.

The founder chooses a few big, unspecific concepts such as “the economy”, “the poor”, “the rich”, “the environment”, etc. These concepts call on to things that are immensely complicated.

The founder places himself on the morally correct side of the equation, and designates an enemy without which “everything will be fixed”.

The principles by which the ideology goes cannot be challenged, and whoever criticizes the new ideology is directly demonized.

This type of theory is attractive to people who are smart, but lazy.

This is what Marx did. He reduced man to his economic value and imposed a lens (the battle of the classes) to view history through. French sociologists at the origin of w0k€n€$$ simply replaced Marx’s economic motivation with “power” and boom, CRT was born.

> Ideological reduction of that form is the hallmark of the most dangerous of pseudo-intellectuals. Ideologues are the intellectual equivalent of fundamentalists, unyielding and rigid.

They’re dangerous because they pretend to be rational, while fundamentalists admit their fundamentalism – so you know who you are dealing with.

### **Ressentiment**

Ressentiment happens when a loser blames the fact he is a loser on the system and on the winners.

The system is “corrupted” and “unfair”, and the winners “steal” or “unfairly benefit”.

Once this has been established, all attacks on the winners are permitted.

In this story, the victims (the losers) are always innocent. If they’re losers, it’s everyone’s fault but theirs.

The path of ressentiment leads to bitterness. It’s also dangerous. Once the enemy has been established, it must be vilified and destroyed.

It’s much healthier to look for mistakes within ourselves than outside of ourselves (“the system”).

If you want to solve the world’s problems, start addressing the ones within yourself.

---

## Rule VII: Work as Hard as You Possibly Can on at Least One Thing and See What Happens.

### **The Value of Heat and Pressure**

Heat and pressure transform coal into diamond. They also transform a person and force him to become aligned with himself.

To be aligned with yourself means to be completely aware. Most of us want to change and be better, but we can’t get ourselves off the couch.

This explains why archaic societies thought our souls were possessed by demons. Psychologists call them impulsions. They can easily take control if we’re not one with ourselves.

How do we become so?

Choose a clear, well-defined, non-contradictory goal.

> Clear goals limit and simplify the world, as well, reducing uncertainty, anxiety, shame, and the self-devouring physiological forces unleashed by stress. The poorly integrated person is thus volatile and directionless—and this is only the beginning.

> If you aim at nothing, you have nowhere to go, nothing to do, and nothing of high value in your life, as value requires the ranking of options and sacrifice of the lower to the higher.

### **The Worst Decision of All**

The worst decision of all is not choosing, not committing. People that can’t commit aren’t happy, and often look for other dubious goals like drugs, alcohol, and party.

> The same holds true for people who cannot choose and then commit to a single romantic partner, or are unable or unwilling to be loyal to their friends. They become lonely, isolated, and miserable, and all that merely adds the additional depth of bitterness to the cynicism that spurred the isolation in the first place.

Those who can’t commit to one road are lost.

It’s better to become something than to try to be anything, and remain nothing.

### **Discipline and Unity**

A child must be socialized by the age of four, or run the risk of never having friends. To play with others, one needs to accept the rules and become disciplined enough to respect them. This discipline stimulates the development of the child by teaching him what he can, and cannot do (with social ostracism as consequence).

![image 2](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20769%20317'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

Discipline helps the child adopt the right behavior to be socially desirable.

Discipline is “forced” by the rules of a “game”. In the west, that game ended up being Christianity. Without a game (aka a set of rules), there is no peace.

When everyone abides by the same set of rules, unity emerges. That unity is what happens when you focus on one goal.

The extreme example of respect for the rules of a game (which we can call dogma) is Christ, which drew his charisma and spirit from this alignment (due to the extreme respect for the rules of the game).

If you work hard on one thing, you will change and find alignment with yourself. That one thing will give you some much-needed discipline.

---

## Rule VIII: Try to Make One Room In Your Home as Beautiful as Possible

### **Cleaning Your Room Is Not Enough**

> Making something beautiful is difficult, but it is amazingly worthwhile.

By doing so, you will become more of yourself, you will better understand the importance of beauty and will develop a relation with it.

Working to make something beautiful is to establish a relationship with the transcendent.

### **The Land You Know, the Land You Do Not Know, and the Land You Cannot Even Imagine**

![image 9](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20426%20228'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

The land you know.

You live in the land you know. Beyond that stands the land you don’t know.

And beyond that is the land no one even knows exists.

The unknown manifests itself with new knowledge. How is that knowledge generated?

It must pass through several levels of analysis. First you react to it physically. If it’s a noise at night, your body moves – or freezes. Then your heart accelerates. This is the second level.

Then you imagine what that noise could be. That’s the third.

Artists are the people that transform the unknown into the known. They transform chaos into order.

### **One Room**

The author explains how his colleagues discouraged him to make his office beautiful. The lesson is that as soon as you stick your neck out, someone will be there to put you back down.

Art is a dangerous initiative, but it can be extremely rewarding.


## Rule IX: If Old Memories Still Upset You, Write Them Down Carefully and Completely

### **But Is Yesterday Finished With You?**

Imagine you have done something bad in the past. You lied, betrayed, cheated, stole, or hurt.

Or imagine that you were victim of such actions.

In both cases, the memories evoke fear, guilt, and shame. Why?

Because you suffered in both cases, and you don’t want these things to happen again.

> Now, if you recall the memory, or if it comes back unbidden, complete with terror, shame, and guilt, this means something specific.

It means you fell into a whole, and that the emotional system does not want you to repeat the mistake.

It means that you are not sharp or aware enough that your emotional system trusts you not to make the mistake yourself, which is why it feels the need to intervene and remind you.

> Learn from the past. Or repeat its horrors, in imagination, endlessly.

People don’t repress as much as they chase away the things they don’t want to think about.

When it comes to trauma, trauma comes back because we can’t come up with a rational explanation that would motivate why anyone did _the trauma_ to us.

The refusal to think about these leaves an area of the memory unexplored and dangerous.

**Anything sufficiently threatful cannot be forgotten if it is not understood.**

We need to know where we are and where we are going. If you don’t know where you came from (what you have gone through), you can’t know where you are.

Where we are going is the ultimate person we’d like to be, with its values, characters, etc.

Successes towards becoming that person feel good. Failures feel bad. They indicate that we don’t understand the world enough.

It indicates that there is something flawed in what we’ve built.

So must go back to these memories, and make sure we’ve learned our lesson.

> Otherwise, we remain in the past, plagued by reminiscences, tormented by conscience, cynical for the loss of what might have been, unforgiving of ourselves, and unable to accept the challenges and tragedies facing us.

We must gather from the past the things we have avoided.

We must put ourselves back together.

> Cynicism about the future rationalizes the avoidance and deception. That is hell, and there is no limit to its depth.

The humility you need to get out of this situation is as big as the size of the errors that you’ve made.

We can’t get out of our responsibilities if we want to actualize potential.

### **Potential Into Actuality**

We don’t decide what to do based on our past. We do so based on our future, on what we want. We directly confront the future when looking for the right course of action.

We face different options, choose one, and by doing so, we transform potential into actuality. We transform what could be, into what is, while simultaneously deciding what will _never be._

Our ethics shape the reality we create.

- Taking responsibility
- Making things better
- Avoiding temptation and facing what we want to avoid
- Acting voluntarily, courageously, and truthfully

These make the future better than the present, while avoiding responsibility, being resentful, make the future worse.

Everyone knows when they do something right, and when they do something wrong, and everyone is tormented by the latter.

### **The Word as Savior**

The fact that we actively shape reality (and its quality) is reflected in our relationships.

These ideas exist in the stories that are at the basis of our culture. If we have these stories, it means we are watching ourselves live to make them up. We make stories because we need to know where we came from to know where we are going.

That’s why we love stories.

In the Bible, God establishes _something_ from _nothing_ with words. Speech is important as it establishes _what is,_ that is, Truth.

> It appears necessarily allied, however, with the courage to confront unrealized possibility in all its awful potential, so that reality itself may be brought forth.

So, Truth isn’t enough, and must be allied with Courage.

These two principles must be united with Love itself – Love for Being.

Love, Courage, and Truth form the Ideal that makes up the best possible future for individuals.

When you have a problem, you know you should solve it or it will grow bigger and cause more problems.

In the same way, the refusal to come to terms with the errors of your past extend them into the present and the future. That makes you weak and a shallow version of yourself. You are less than you could be because you did not change.

Since you didn’t learn, you may commit the same error in the future.

So you must confess, repent, and change.

If the chaos of your past has not been ordered, it will keep on haunting you.

Trauma is the indication that your “map of the world” isn’t enough to guide you. You need to update it.

> And it is not the expression of emotion associated with unpleasant events that has curative power. It is the development of a sophisticated causal theory: Why was I at risk? What was it about the world that made it dangerous?

If old memories still upset you, write them down carefully and completely.

## Rule X: Plan and Work Diligently to Maintain The Romance in Your Relationship

### **Bedrock**

Many times the state of a relationship is embodied in the sex life, but not always. Some couples hate each other yet have sex all the time, and others like each other but don’t. Sex is not all, so fixing a sex life won’t fix the relationship.

You need a strategy to maintain romance with your partner. The first thing to do is to know what you want out of the relationship so you know when you succeed/fail at getting it.

If you can’t formulate your desires, your partner will have to guess, and you’ll likely punish them if they guess wrong.

The alternative (namely, knowing what you want), unfortunately, isn’t better: if you know what you want and tell your partner, you’ve given them a weapon they can use against you.

Many people eventually get hurt by someone they loved, learned the true nature of mankind, and replaced their naivete with cynicism. Cynicism is better, but it’s not ideal.

The ideal is non-naive trust. Non-naive trust requires courage.

This is risky, but such is the price of intimacy.

Trust, furthermore, has an important requirement: **truth**. You cannot maintain trust if you lie.

### **Christ in the Candle**

When couples get married, it may happen that they jointly hold a candle together. Why?

There is the idea that before Eve, Adam was hermaphroditic. Eve was made out of one of Adam’s ribs. Understand: man needs to unite with woman to be whole again.

Who is subordinate to whom in a relationship? Answer: neither. Both are subordinate to the principle of truth.

Both are oriented and willing to build the best possible future for them.

We have this innate desire to find that one person that will complete us.

Being single leads to a feeling of incompletion.

There is a lot of utility in [marriage](https://auresnotes.com/jordan-peterson-is-wrong-about-marriage-2/). The vow not to split isn’t a vow per se, but a threat. The meaning is “we are not getting rid of each other, so we need to make it work whatever the cost”.

The part of us attached to freedom wishes for a safety exit door in a marriage, but this isn’t wise to get one. If you know you can get out of it at any time, you won’t make enough effort to make your marriage work. Marriage is a forcing function for the good development of your character.

Hope for a good marriage isn’t enough. You need desperation, which you get when you don’t have a choice.

And it’s going to be difficult.

You will fight with your partner. You will make mistakes. And you will suffer.

There are three states of social being.

- Slavery
- Tyranny
- Negotiation

Neither slavery nor tyranny is good. So you must negotiate.

### **Negotiation, Tyranny, or Slavery**

Negotiations start when partners are outlying what they want. Most of the time, they don’t know what they want.

One must absolutely force the other to define what they want, for their own good, and no matter the cost (screams, tears, insults, etc).

If you don’t force people to solve their unresolved problems, they might never do so.

In the short-term, negotiation is the hardest option, but it is by far the best one in the long term. If you do end up escaping, you won’t achieve the transformation.

Negotiating furthermore means that _you might succeed._ And then you could have children, then grandchildren, etc.

Many people say they don’t want children, but they almost always end up regretting it (particularly women).

So don’t waste time finding a good mate and getting married. You don’t have much of it.

### **The Domestic Economy**

Prior to the invention of birth control, men did male things and women did female things. It was good, as it gave a template of who would do what.

Whether you want to follow this role or not, you will have to decide who does what in your relationship.

Eg:

- Who makes the bed?
- Whose career is a priority?
- Who cleans?
- Who educates the children?
- How are the bank accounts managed?
- Who shops for groceries?
- Who pays the taxes?

You need to define the responsibilities of everyone.

To ease things out, talk to your partner for at least 90 minutes per week about practical matters. What needs to be done, how is life at work, how do you feel about x and y, etc.

This will make your household much more peaceful than if it’s not done.

When you are young, you make two assumptions about relationships.

1. There is out there someone who is perfect.
2. There is out there someone who is perfect for you.

No one is perfect. And if there were a perfect person, they wouldn’t date you, which is good. If they did, they’d be blind, desperate, or as lame as you are.

### **Finally: Romance**

Romance comes last because romance is play, and play comes out when all other problems have been solved.

Couples who work full time and have children usually manage to have sex 1-3 times a week.

Whatever you do, don’t let it go down to zero.

If you do, someone is going to have an affair.

You should also plan which day you will have sex. When you are as busy as people are nowadays, you cannot hope for spontaneity.

You must make space and time for sex, or you won’t do it (eg: Tuesday at 21h).

Buy some lingerie, buy some sexy outfit, and wear it. Buy some candles and light them up. And do not punish your partner for doing something you enjoy. Do not be ashamed either.

## Rule XI: Do Not Allow Yourself to Become Resentful, Deceitful, or Arrogant

### **The Story Is the Thing**

You have your reasons for becoming resentful, deceitful, or arrogant. If you want to resist this decline, you need to understand your own motivation for evil.

Let’s start with the following question: _what is the world made of?_ The world is made of everything perceived by an individual.

Imagine you wake up in the morning. What do you perceive? You perceive your day, week, month, or entire life, and the myriad of possibilities ahead.

What are you going to make out of these possibilities? This is the potential you have, and it is limitless. There is everything good that awaits you, but also everything bad.

_What could be_ is the question you need to answer. It’s the purpose of life. _What is_ is already gone. It’s the present, and it goes fast. _What could be_ is what is really interesting.

So, how do you investigate _what could be?_

You do so with stories.

We use stories to communicate, to represent the past, and the present. We can also use them for the future.

Let’s have a look at the characters of that story.

### **The Eternal Characters of the Human Drama**

**The Dragon of Chaos**

Potential can be a place for unimaginable chaos.

Eg: one minute you’re camping, the next the forest caught fire and you need to run for your life.

Psychologically, this means that the malevolence that exists in people’s hearts can suddenly arise – and that’s the case for your malevolence too.

### **Nature: Creation and Destruction**

Nature creates trees, cute animals, nice landscapes. But nature is also death, worms, mold.

Nature creates, but nature takes back as well.

In tales, nature is the Evil Queen, and the Fairy Godmother. You need to be acquainted with these two characters.

Some only know abuse in their childhood. It’s then difficult to grow up and avoid hate, distrust, and revenge.

Should it be the case, you need to find your Fairy Godmother. When you understand the duality and the polarity of nature, you understand sacrifice.

Sacrifice is giving up something good now to keep evil at bay for later.

### **Culture: Security and Tyranny**

The Tyrant King and the Wise King are used to conceptualizing culture. The Wise King insists on safekeeping the culture as it is because it has always worked this way. The Tyrant King is the revolutionary that wants to change everything.

You need both.

### **The Individual: Hero and Adversary**

If the night is chaos, the ocean is nature, and the island is culture, then the individual – the hero is locked on the island in a combat with his twin (hero and adversary).

The hero can sacrifice, is awake, and is responsible. The adversary is everything despicable.

To summarize, the seven characters are:

1. The Hero
2. The Adversary
3. The Wise King
4. The Tyrant
5. A positive maternal figure
6. A negative maternal figure
7. Chaos itself

You need to understand that

- You have within you the seeds of both successes (hero) and destruction (adversary).
- Culture constantly tends toward tyranny.
- Someone who is benevolent can become malevolent pretty quickly.

### **Resentment**

> You are resentful because of the absolute unknown and its terrors, because nature conspires against you, because you are a victim of the tyrannical element of culture, and because of the malevolence of yourself and other individuals.

You’re angry at the world because the world isn’t fair, and you’re angry at yourself because you do things you shouldn’t.

Now, it’s important to see exactly what is your fault in your misfortune, and what isn’t.

It’s also important to realize that most of what happened to you didn’t happen personally – that it was part of the tragedies of life.

Finally, not all tragedies have tragedic consequences.

What doesn’t kill you makes you stronger.

When you confront the difficulties of life directly, you become stronger – and less resentful.

### **Deceit and Arrogance**

There are two types of deceit:

- **Sins of Commission**: stuff you do but you know you shouldn’t (lying).
- **Sins of Ommission**: stuff you don’t do which you know you should (clean your room).

Why do we do this? Because we’re resentful. We justify these bad deeds as defense against the bad things that were done to us.

**Commissions**

When God creates the universe out of nothing, he does it out of love. Arrogance and deceit oppose this idea, and instead say that any childish desire can exist, even if self-serving.

Understand: arrogance and deceit tell you you have no ideal to serve, that you can do whatever you want for selfish reasons.

There is a second type of arrogance that enables deceit. Someone who lies is arrogant enough to change the structure of reality because they think that their selfish desire to change it will give a better version of what would exist otherwise (the truth).

![Altering the fabric of reality.](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20394%20299'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

Altering the fabric of reality.

> That is the arrogance of someone who believes that he can alter the structure of reality through pretense, and that he can get away with it.

This leads to two problems.

1. This person won’t be trusted.
2. This person will inhabit a world that isn’t true, hence will be weaker.

The third form of arrogance comes from the fact that the liar thinks that the lie won’t be uncovered. But it will.

The fourth form of arrogance comes from a sense of justice. “Because I have been hurt, I am entitled to hurt too”.

**Ommissions**

Why do we stand by when we witness things we know to be wrong?

1. **Nihilism**: one who is too proud is certain that nothing matters. It’s a dangerous assumption. Humility would dictate that we don’t know that for sure.
2. **It’s ok to take the easy path**: this way, you avoid taking responsibility on your shoulders.
3. **You lack faith in yourself**: so you don’t react because you don’t believe you can make a difference.

### **The Existential Danger of Arrogance and Deceit**

Deception corrupts the instinct that enables you to orientate yourself in life.

Garbage in, garbage out. If you feed this instinct lie, you will be disoriented. The more you do it, the less you can rely on this instinct, the more lost you become.

### **The Place You Should Be**

When we wake up in the morning, we know we can do good things, and we know we can do bad things.

The right attitude to have is that there is enough of you, society, and the world to justify its existence.

That is, having faith in your capacity to build a good life for yourself.

Do not allow yourself to become resentful, deceitful, or arrogant.

## Rule XII: Be Grateful in Spite of Your Suffering

### **Down Can Define Up**

We can confront our suffering. We can transcend it.

> If you confront the limitations of life courageously, that provides you with a certain psychological purpose that serves as an antidote to the suffering.

If you act in a noble manner, you can decrease your own suffering and the suffering of other people. You can actively work on it.

Furthermore, it is by going through episodes of intense suffering that you can find intense joy at the end.

> The act of peering into the darkness as deeply as possible reveals a light that appears unquenchable.

The same goes for gratitude. You can’t appreciate all that you have unless you lose it all.

### **The Mephistophelian Spirit**

In the play _Faust,_ Faust sells his soul to the devil Mephistopheles against knowledge. Mephistopheles is a character that works against positive intent.

We all have Mephistopheles inside us: we do stuff we know we shouldn’t and ignore stuff we know we should not.

We’re not entirely in control of ourselves. But then, who is? Why don’t you do what you should? Sometimes, it’s just easier.

Sometimes, we don’t know. It’s due to a “spirit” that manifests itself when we say “I don’t know why I did this”. Why does such a spirit exist?

Because we have limits to morality. We are subjugated by the suffering we, nature, and society, inflict upon us.

Given all that, it’s difficult to assume that you will inherently be satisfied with yourself.

The whole thing becomes a vicious circle: you are unhappy, so you inflict more unhappiness upon yourself.

The natural follow-up to this is antinatalism. Since everyone suffers, shouldn’t we just halt it all? That would make things worse.

No. If things don’t go well, you don’t want to make them worse. This is illogical.

When someone dies, you should be the person everyone counts on. A failure to be so would betray the person that has died (since they likely didn’t want you to suffer). If you can be that person, it means you’re strong enough in the face of adversity.

You should be grateful for that. Life is not easy but you have the means to confront the suffering and triumph.

Even if you see the bitterness, you **choose to be grateful because it is the courageous thing to do.**

### **Courage-but Superordinate, Love**

The reasons for bitterness, cynicism, anger, resentment, etc are so many that it’s difficult to rationally counter them. Instead, it should be a leap of faith, a decision that we make to keep on doing the right things no matter what happens.

This is where courage and love intervene. It’s when you decide you won’t stop making things better for yourself – no matter what happens.
