-   Nonverbal cues and verbal prompts to get people to like you instantly
    1.  You must be willing to learn and master the techniques presented in this book

    2.  You must actually use this new knowledge in dealing with people in your everyday life
        -   Knowledge without action is knowledge wasted
    3.  You must constantly practice what you learn


-   Chapter 1: the Friendship Formula
    -   The **Friendship Formula** consists of the four basic building blocks: _proximity_, _frequency_, _duration_, and _intensity_
        -   People who share physical space are more likely to become attracted to one another even when no words are exchanged
            -   The key is that it must take place in a non-threatening environment
        -   **_Intensity_** is how strongly you are able to satisfy another person’s psychological or physical needs through the use of verbal and nonverbal behaviors
        -   **_Duration_** has a unique quality in that the more time you spend with the person, the more influence they have over your thoughts and actions
            -   Duration usually has an inverse relationship with _**frequency**_
                -   The more frequent you see them, the last time you spend
                -   The less we can see them, the more time we tend to spend with them
    -   The combination of the elements of the friendship formula can also help identify the strength of a relationship between a couple
    -   Establishing common ground is the fastest way to build rapport
    -   You can _consciously or subconsciously send off foe or friend signals_ to others around you
        -   The **urban scowl** sends a clear, nonverbal signal to others that you are a foe, not a friend. It is a warning to stay away and don’t screw with me.

    -   Three critical and nonverbal cues: _eyebrow flash_, _head tilt_, and a _real smile_
        -   Prolonged eye contact between two people indicates intense emotion, whether in love or hostility
            -   A long eyebrow flash will actually send a foe signal
        -   A head tilt to the right or left is a non-threatening gesture
            -   People who tilt their head when meeting other people are seen as more trustworthy and attractive
        -   A **smile** is a powerful friend signal. Smiling faces are judged to be more attractive, more likable, and less dominant
            -   A smile portrays confidence, happiness, and enthusiasm, and acceptance
            -   Genuine smiles are more symmetrical and timed differently than fake smiles
            -   Learning to produce a real smile at will, particularly when you don’t feel in the mood to display it, takes practice

            -   Pupil dilation expresses interest
    -   **Touching** is a powerful, subtle, but complex form of nonverbal communication
        -   Even the most fleeting touch can have a dramatic influence on our perceptions and relationships
        -   A risk-free way to measure the strength of a new relationship is to accidentally touch or brush against the hand of your person of interest
            -   Most people will tolerate an accidental touch, but they will unconsciously send nonverbal signals indicating the acceptance or rejection of the touch
    -   **Isopraxism**, mirroring the behavior of another person. A nonverbal practice that can be used to make friendship development easier and more effective

    -   People tend to lean towards people they like and distance themselves from people they don’t like
    -   **_Whispering_** is an intimate behavior and positive friend signal. Not everyone can whisper in your ear with impunity
        -   When you see whispering taking place between two individuals, you can be relatively certain a close personal relationship exists
    -   **Food forking** is a friend signal and indicates a close relationship between the person possessing the food and the person forking it
    -   People who like one another tend to display more expressive gestures
    -   Head nods can have various different cues towards the speaker
        -   Verbal nudges let the speaker know not only that you are listening but also validating the speaker’s message with a verbal confirmation

    -   **Elevator eyes**, looking someone up and down, can be seen as an invasion of personal space
        -   The police officer has the authority to look at you and into your car, but the opposite is not true for you
        -   A big giveaway for undercover officers is when their body language shows they feel like they have the authority to gaze and look in forbidden spaces
    -   Rolling your eyes gives the signal that you think the speaker is stupid, a clear foe signal
        -   Squinting and furrowed eyebrows are other forms of negative signals
        -   Tense facial expressions and aggressive stances
    -   Your environment and context will determine if your outfit will be interpreted as a friend or enemy signal
        -   If you don’t pay attention to the details it can expose you for who you are. This is true in dress attire as well
        -   A mask is a very powerful foe signal
    -   Example of a dog reacting negatively to the dog lover who stares directly at it and approaches him, but reacts positively to the dog hater who ignores and doesn’t look at him. One challenges the dogs personal space, and the other does not
    -   _**Foot signals**_ in group circles can be very telling, as feet pointed towards the center show closed groups, and feet and body positions opened up shows receptivity to new members

        -   There is a fine line between confidence and arrogance when displaying signals as a newcomer to a group
    -   If you can’t readily find common ground, you can default to music because everyone likes music, even if not the same music

    -   Techniques to make people feel good about themselves: **empathic statements**
        -   These keep the focus of the conversation on the person you’re talking with rather than on yourself
        -   A great way to start an empathetic statement is with, “so you…”
    -   A definite line separates flattery from compliments
        -   The purpose of compliments is to _praise others and acknowledge their accomplishments_
    -   You can use **_third-party complements_** to complement the person and take credit for it makes him feel good even if you didn’t say it

        -   Look for potential commonalities when you see people
        -   Vicarious experiences, living out an experience or lifestyle through another person
    -   **Misattribution**: being at the right place at the right time
        -   When they feel good because of a place or experience, they tend to _attribute that feeling to the person they were with_
        -   You can use misattribution by organizing a fun activity with someone or people to get them to like you
        -   Use misattribution by being in close proximity with someone after a workout when endorphins are released or after frightening experiences
    -   _The law of curiosity_:
        -   Curiosity can be used as a book to increase intensity and pique a person’s interest in you

        -   Laughing also releases endorphins and also signifies if the person likes someone by how much they laugh at their jokes
    -   _The law of familiarity_:
        -   The more we meet and interact with people, the more likely we are to become friends

        -   High-status women usually try to couple with high-status men
    -   _The law of availability/ scarcity_:

        -   Increased restraint increases drive
    -   _The law of personality_
        -   Extroverts versus introverts. Knowing the other person’s personality type will help you dissipate what to expect in terms of your interaction with them

        -   The more you can encourage the other person to speak, the more you listen to what they say, display empathy and respond positively when reacting to their comments, the greater the likelihood the person will feel good about themselves and like you as a result
        -   **Communication** is much more than conveying ideas, it also encompasses how you _convey them in real-world situations_
        -   A person who is forced into a defensive position is less likely to except new ideas
            -   Creating an adversarial environment to language creates or enforces concepts of winners and losers
    -   **Cognitive dissonance** is triggered when a person holds two or more conflicting believes simultaneously
    -   **Ego**: people are naturally egocentric

    -   **LOVE** = Listen, Observe, Vocalize, Empathize
    -   Empathic statements are the spice of conversations

    -   Once an opinion or decision is expressed out loud, changing a persons mind becomes more difficult due to the psychological principle of consistency

        -   Touching of the lips means the person is uneasy about the topic that is being discussed
    -   _Attraction_ and _interest_, for example, are communicated much more by the _tone of voice_ than by the words being spoken
    -   When you are right and someone else is wrong, give that individual a face saving way to carry out your wishes with a minimum of embarrassment and humiliation
        -   Making someone feel wrong in front of people causes unnecessary tension and strife
        -   Instead of asserting your right to be right, ask people for their advice. That allows them to be part of the decision-making process
    -   An alternate response question gives the other person the illusion of control but doesn’t relinquish authority
        -   Strategy 2: use the technique of status elevation to make people feel better about themselves and see you as a friend
        -   Strategy 3: if you want to get information from somebody without arousing suspicion or putting them on the defensive, use the elicitation approach
    -   **Elicitation** is the ability to _obtain sensitive information_ from people without then realizing they are providing you with this data
        -   The human need to correct an elicitation through presumptive statements. People have a need to be right but an even stronger need to correct others
    -   The **internal external elicitation technique**: Asking someone a question as a third-party can reveal how they really feel on a topic
    -   Making an emphatic statement that also allows the person to complement themselves is most effective
    -   Common conversational pitfalls:
        1.  Avoid talking about topics that engender negative feelings in your listener. Negative feelings make people feel bad about themselves and consequently, they will like you less

        -   Angry people need time to calm down before they can think clearly again. The body takes about 20 minutes to return to normal after a full fight or flight response

Instead of sharing, place them in separate sealed envelopes and store away in a safe place. If the relationship goes sour, you can give each other the letters and read them.
