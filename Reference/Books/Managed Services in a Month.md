- Model of growth

**The core components of the Managed Service Model are

recurring monthly fee**

#### Servers and Options
MIcrosoft Server
	- Server Essentials 
		- Cheaper starting cost 
		- Fairly easy to run on a cheaper server
		- No sharepoint, Exchange, SQL server 
		- low end

### Cloud Hosting
- Hosted storage, Hosted backup, hosted exchange services, hosted SQL.
- You might not need to spend alot on server software if you outsource most of the heavy lifting to the cloud
- You can buy storage in bulk and sell in a smaller chunk to make a profit
- buy instances of hosted spam filtering or remote moniotoring at bulk then deliver them in packages of 1, 5, 10 

### Inexpensive hardware
- Stay away from that you want to keep your customers happy and you can't do that with crappy hardware that needs alot of maintence
- Stick with Business-class servers and desktops with 3 years of warranty
- Matters less the more you get a client unto a cloud based workflow

- Try to include the Hardware: Firewalls switch desktops and UPS's
	- Ups your monthly fee and your passive income
- Your goal should be to include as many services as possible that is included in your monthly fee


### Mobile Devices

**MDM** or mobile device management is a huge oppurtunity to sell more managed serves to the company. 


 ``` ad-note Note
Always be looking for new upcoming managed services to sell the rate of tech today is amazing.
```

### Cloud Computing in the Small Business Space

1. Cloud-based services - those that exist entirely in the cloud. (salesforce,QuickBooks Online)
2. Hosted servers - 
3. Hosted services
4. Hybrid cloud offerings


#### Cloud-based services

If you resell a cloud based service, it’s usually the case that you buy at
wholesale and sell at retail.

If you are an **affiliate** for the service, you make the sale, but the
client gives their credit card to the service provider.

Some services give you a commission for as long as the client
is their customer.
	-So even if you decide to part ways you still get paid commision for as long as they are a customer to said service

OTP you earn a much larger commision at the beginning.

Bundle all your offerings into one big bundle

exchange mail, storage on a server, spam filtering, anti-virus and RMM

#### Hosted Servers

This is Hosting the server needs of a company off-prem on another company's infrastructure.

Normally done using Windows Server Or a Linux-based server.

> [!note]+ Note
> All the server maintenance and upkeep (I.e Patching updating security monitoring) but be accounted for.

*All of this can be automated for a easier workflow*.
