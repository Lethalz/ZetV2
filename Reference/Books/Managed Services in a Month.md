What is Managed Service?
	Technical Support delivered under a service agreement that
	provides specified rates and guarantees the consultant a
	specific minimum income.
	**NOT:** Break/fix tech support 
	On-demand Support

cloud + managed service offerings
- Good for recurring revenue contracts
- Build passive income
- Supplying a flat fee for everything they need 
- Model of growth
- file storage, backup , email, spam filtering, firewall ,switches.. endless
- RMM and PSA needed


**Managed service Pricing** 
Buy 500 licenses and sell when you need to more effecient.


**The core components of the Managed Service Model are
• An RMM agent on every server and every desktop
• A PSA system for tracking time and billing
• Support service that bundles all this together for a regular,
recurring monthly fee**

#### Servers and Options
MIcrosoft Server
	- Server Essentials 
		- Cheaper starting cost 
		- Fairly easy to run on a cheaper server
		- No sharepoint, Exchange, SQL server 
		- low end

### Cloud Hosting
- Hosted storage, Hosted backup, hosted exchange services, hosted SQL.
- You might not need to spend alot on server software if you outsource most of the heavy lifting to the cloud
- You can buy storage in bulk and sell in a smaller chunk to make a profit
- buy instances of hosted spam filtering or remote moniotoring at bulk then deliver them in packages of 1, 5, 10 

### Inexpensive hardware
- Stay away from that you want to keep your customers happy and you can't do that with crappy hardware that needs alot of maintence
- Stick with Business-class servers and desktops with 3 years of warranty
- Matters less the more you get a client unto a cloud based workflow

- Try to include the Hardware: Firewalls switch desktops and UPS's
	- Ups your monthly fee and your passive income
- Your goal should be to include as many services as possible that is included in your monthly fee


### Mobile Devices

**MDM** or mobile device management is a huge oppurtunity to sell more managed serves to the company. 


 ``` ad-note Note
Always be looking for new upcoming managed services to sell the rate of tech today is amazing.
```

## Cloud Computing in the Small Business Space

1. Cloud-based services - those that exist entirely in the cloud. (salesforce,QuickBooks Online)
2. Hosted servers - 
3. Hosted services
4. Hybrid cloud offerings


#### Cloud-based services

If you resell a cloud based service, it’s usually the case that you buy at
wholesale and sell at retail.

If you are an **affiliate** for the service, you make the sale, but the
client gives their credit card to the service provider.

Some services give you a commission for as long as the client
is their customer.
	-So even if you decide to part ways you still get paid commision for as long as they are a customer to said service

OTP you earn a much larger commision at the beginning.

Bundle all your offerings into one big bundle

exchange mail, storage on a server, spam filtering, anti-virus and RMM

#### Hosted Servers

This is Hosting the server needs of a company off-prem on another company's infrastructure.

Normally done using Windows Server Or a Linux-based server.

> [!note]+ Note
> All the server maintenance and upkeep (I.e Patching updating security monitoring) but be accounted for.

*All of this can be automated for a easier workflow*.



#### Hosted Services
Great for small clients
while hosted servers are better for bigger clients
	10 users for 15$ a mailbox makes sense 
	1000 users for 15$ a mailbox doesnt













#### Hybrid Cloud
- Cloud services with some components on site
- clients pays you for a small server that backs up data to the cloud and is instantly available
- Pay someone to develop

Hosted servers require about the same amount of maintenance as a physical server at a client office.

Hosted services require no maintenance on your part.
