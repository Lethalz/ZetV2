# Managed Services in a Month
What is Managed Service?
	Technical Support delivered under a service agreement that
	provides specified rates and guarantees the consultant a
	specific minimum income.
	**NOT:** Break/fix tech support 
	On-demand Support

cloud + managed service offerings
- Good for recurring revenue contracts
- Build passive income
- Supplying a flat fee for everything they need 
- Model of growth
- file storage, backup , email, spam filtering, firewall ,switches.. endless
- RMM and PSA needed


**Managed service Pricing** 
Buy 500 licenses and sell when you need to more effecient.


**The core components of the Managed Service Model are
• An RMM agent on every server and every desktop
• A PSA system for tracking time and billing
• Support service that bundles all this together for a regular,
recurring monthly fee**

#### Servers and Options
MIcrosoft Server
	- Server Essentials 
		- Cheaper starting cost 
		- Fairly easy to run on a cheaper server
		- No sharepoint, Exchange, SQL server 
		- low end

### Cloud Hosting
- Hosted storage, Hosted backup, hosted exchange services, hosted SQL.
- You might not need to spend alot on server software if you outsource most of the heavy lifting to the cloud
- You can buy storage in bulk and sell in a smaller chunk to make a profit
- buy instances of hosted spam filtering or remote moniotoring at bulk then deliver them in packages of 1, 5, 10 

### Inexpensive hardware
- Stay away from that you want to keep your customers happy and you can't do that with crappy hardware that needs alot of maintence
- Stick with Business-class servers and desktops with 3 years of warranty
- Matters less the more you get a client unto a cloud based workflow

- Try to include the Hardware: Firewalls switch desktops and UPS's
	- Ups your monthly fee and your passive income
- Your goal should be to include as many services as possible that is included in your monthly fee


### Mobile Devices

**MDM** or mobile device management is a huge oppurtunity to sell more managed serves to the company. 


 ``` ad-note Note
Always be looking for new upcoming managed services to sell the rate of tech today is amazing.
```

## Cloud Computing in the Small Business Space

1. Cloud-based services - those that exist entirely in the cloud. (salesforce,QuickBooks Online)
2. Hosted servers - 
3. Hosted services
4. Hybrid cloud offerings


#### Cloud-based services

If you resell a cloud based service, it’s usually the case that you buy at
wholesale and sell at retail.

If you are an **affiliate** for the service, you make the sale, but the
client gives their credit card to the service provider.

Some services give you a commission for as long as the client
is their customer.
	-So even if you decide to part ways you still get paid commision for as long as they are a customer to said service

OTP you earn a much larger commision at the beginning.

Bundle all your offerings into one big bundle

exchange mail, storage on a server, spam filtering, anti-virus and RMM

#### Hosted Servers

This is Hosting the server needs of a company off-prem on another company's infrastructure.

Normally done using Windows Server Or a Linux-based server.

> [!note]+ Note
> All the server maintenance and upkeep (I.e Patching updating security monitoring) but be accounted for.

*All of this can be automated for a easier workflow*.



#### Hosted Services
Great for small clients
while hosted servers are better for bigger clients
	10 users for 15$ a mailbox makes sense 
	1000 users for 15$ a mailbox doesnt













#### Hybrid Cloud
- Cloud services with some components on site
- clients pays you for a small server that backs up data to the cloud and is instantly available
- Pay someone to develop

Hosted servers require about the same amount of maintenance as a physical server at a client office.

Hosted services require no maintenance on your part.

# The Managed Service Model

### New and existing MSPs

For new msps it is much better to get clients that are willing to do business within your model than to just go for the biggest clients you can get.

Don't change your offerings and specilizations based on your client
	Create the ideal client and provide the best service for them.\\

Before you’re finished with this book you should have the following three things in place:

a. A PSA (professional services automation) tool  
b. An RMM (remote monitoring and management) tool c. A financial package such as QuickBooks

### managed service in a month

Managed service is - Technical Support delivered under a service agreement that provides specified rates and guarantees the consultant a specific minimum income.

• Prepayment for services  
• Guaranteed minimum income  
• Control of the IT function at the client’s office
• Service agreements that formalize your relationship with the client

Basic steps to go through 

• Start making a plan  
• Create a three-tiered pricing structure  
• Weed your client garden  
• Finish the plan  
• Write a service agreement and have it reviewed by an attorney • Print up your new pricing plan  
• Meet with each of your clients and have them pick one of the new plans. Drop any client who does not sign a new agreement. 
• As the money starts rolling in, buy into a PSA system and an RMM system. These will make you even more profitable.


#### Best Practices for Any Model

1. Track all of your time
2. Sign contracts (service agreements) with every client
3. Get prepaid for everything you do
4. Have and use a ticketing system
5. Have and use a remote monitoring  and maintenance system (RMM)
6. Invoice on a regular, predictable schedule


## Managed service and B/F
### Break Fix
- Not ideal
- Time/Money 
- Profitable but hinderence
 

A good Break/fix is:
 1.  organized and not haphazard.
 2. signs contracts creating a professional relationship
 3. Tracks time , Tracks Priority
 4. Billing is Accurate and Prompt
5. Needs a rock-solid foundation

### Managed service 
take over maintenance of systems 
prevent problems before they happen
- try and flatten the client bill
- while maximizing recurring revenue
- Pre-pay for hours for a better rate

Monthly maintenance for systems
 - applying patches, fixes, updates
 - verifying anti-virius
 - checking logs
 - testing backups

Flat fee service for mainentnance
  time per workstation per month + 1 hour of server maintanance and 1 hour of network rack maintanance.
	

If you are managed youd want the RMM to remotely do these things.
 - Dont give away RMM tools for free 
 - reduces labor but still a service

### Hybrid Model
 This means that some clients are on a break/
fix model and some are on managed service.
gradually get all those break/
fix folks to sign up for managed service. 

In the long run Break/Fix is way more expensive than the Managed service model.
—Pre-Pay for a certain amount of time per month plus the other maintance things and they would pay less but you will do less if you prevent issues properly.

The Hybrid MSPs will make more money from their break/fix clients but they lose out on time for growth
Never give away support/tools that are meant for your managed service clients







### 







## Managed Services and Cloud Service

Managed services and cloud services
work perfectly together! 

In the cloud services model, the cost of
services is unrelated to the price you charge.

Say that again for the people in the back.

For Example ,
A bundle that includes RMM plus spam
filtering and a hosted mailbox might cost you $10 and be sold for any number you can imagine.

- Put together bundles
- Low maintnance 
- volume is your friend
- price breaks for people that buy into your model

The more stuff thats on the cloud the less that breaks.
	1. Storage
	2. Email
	3. Spam filtering
	4. Office 365
	5. Cloud anti-virus
	6. Web-servers
	7. etc.. etc..

Examples 
	• Microsoft Azure
	• Rackspace (O365, storage, email, etc.)
	• Intermedia (O365, storage, email, etc.)
	• AppRiver (O365, storage, email, etc.)
	• JungleDisk (storage)
	• DreamHost (web hosting)


# Getting Started 

### Start Making a Plan

 - Make decisions and then implement
them. And don’t be afraid. Every decision is reversible.
- Consider your new pricing plan.

### Rules and Policies

- Many consultants work on payment terms of 20 or 30 days. You can’t do this with software and hardware any more.

Here are your new policies going forward:
	1. Hardware and software must be prepaid. The process is simple.You’ll give the client a quote. The client will sign the quote and email or efax it back to you with credit card / ACH information(more on this later). Or the client will mail a check. Once you have payment, you order the equipment.
	2. All contracts must be prepaid. Option one is by credit card, to be billed on the first of the month. Option two is by **check**, to be prepaid three months in advance.
	3. You’ll still have hourly labor for project work (anything outside the flat fee portion of the service agreement). This will be on terms of net 20 days.
	4. You will assess finance charges on the first of each month for all monies past due. You will enforce this. In some states you won’t be able to enforce this without a signed contract.
	5. All clients must sign a service agreement. You should have been doing this all along.

### Know What You Know About What You Sell.

Find out where your money comes from.
Know your numbers

• Hardware
• Software
• Other stuff
• Labor - Hourly
• Labor – MSA (Managed Service Agreement)

In order to generate the reports you need, you have to enter information correctly into QuickBooks at the time of the sale.

Expect an influx of cash when you transition to flat-fee managedservice. First, there are pre-payments. Second, there are setup fees.

## Starting fresh


1. define your personal goals and lifestyle.
2. define your company’s purpose and goals.
3. find and implement a remote monitoring and maintenance (RMM) tool to deliver your services.
4. find and implement a professional services automation(PSA) tool to run your business.
5. properly set up your financial tool (e.g., QuickBooks) soyou can monitor the financial health of your business and developstrategic plans.
6. develop rigorous processes and procedures so your business will run well – with you or without you.

Please Don’t Do Break/Fix!
I like to give people two pieces of advice about picking their business
model:
- You don’t have to pick up every nickel you find.
- You don’t have to adopt every stray puppy that shows up on
your doorstep.

### MSP/LIFE Commandments

• Focus on the highest value tasks at all times. Don’t waste your time every day and then wonder why you’re not getting ahead.

• Focus your business as narrowly as you can (find a niche). I know it sounds counter-intuitive when you’re starting out, but
it’s true.

• Surround yourself with smart, positive people, and fun people.

•Hire the best professional help (accountants, attorneys, etc.) because they’ll save you money in the long run.

• Never do business with friends.
Comment: I think this is 90% true. There are exceptions, but the friend relationship makes a lot of business decisions murky.

• Never hire family. Similar to above.
Comment: I agree with this generally. But I somehow managed to hire my brother Manuel Palachuk and keep him around for
7-8 years, and he did miracles for my business.

• If you work with your spouse, decide very quickly whether it is good for you personally and professionally. I’ve seen it both
ways. If it’s bad, stop as soon as possible. You might save your marriage and your business.

• Outsource as much as you can. Or delegate as much as you can. The bottom line: Leverage people to help you get more done.

• Fear is the biggest obstacle to success.

• You only have to be a little better at what you do to be far superior to other people in your business. Most people do not have a goal to be excellent.

• The right time to fire someone is the first time the thought crosses your mind. After that you’ll just waste more and more effort accepting the inevitable.

• Be careful about the advice you take. Everyone is happy to tell you how they do what they do. But if they are scratching to get
by, please don’t do what they do. Listen to successful people.

• Document everything. Everything you do. Everything you promise. Every process and procedure. If you start to be successful, you’ll want to clone yourself. That means you have to have all that documentation in place.

• Be expensive. Never be the cheapest in your market. Assuming you are actually competent, be among the most expensive in
your market. You’ll never lose money by charging more. If you are not sure how good you are, be in the middle of the market.

• Define your ideal client and go after them. Do not worry about all the money you “leave on the table.” If you just have a bit of the
money from your ideal clients, you’ll be very successful.

• Fire clients who are negative, abusive, don’t pay their bills, or simply add stress to your company. My brother says I should
write a book on how to get rich firing your largest client.

• The first employee you should hire is an administrative assistant, not a technician. Lots of work will “disappear” and you’ll be able
to spend more of your time on higher-value tasks.

•  Be yourself! Be authentic. Do not worry too much about turning off potential clients. Do not go about being bland and boring in order to make sure you never turn off a potential
client. Stand for something and many clients will flock to you.

• Never ever, no matter what, take money out of your retirement accounts. I know this is hard to believe, especially if you are young, but you should let your business die rather than rob from yourself and your family. People fall into this trap all the time.

• No client is indispensable. No employee is indispensable. You are not indispensable.

• Never stop learning.
Learn your craft. Learn new technologies.
Learn about business, and people, and ideas.
Read as much as you can. Or listen to audio.

- The most important step in any path to success is to create a
roadmap.




## Per User vs. Per Device Pricing

- Maybe consider per user in places where they have alotof devices that need maintanace
- You don’t need to fret about the top line (the price you charge); You need to focus on the bottom line (the money you get to keep).
- Counting devices is becoming much more difficult.
- The proliferation of devices results in a greater focus on the users rather than their devices.


## Create A Three-Tiered Pricing Structure


Platnum
Gold
Silver

List provided service 
x• Services on the server/domain  
• Services on the desktop or workstation  
• Other services (network, printers, ISP, etc.)

E.g 
Silver covers servers only. Gold covers servers and workstations. Platinum covers everything we could throw in the mix.


# Backup and Other Add-On Offerings

## Building a Catalog of Services

Generally speaking, you will sell six kinds of products and services. They are:

• Standardized hardware, software, and materials. This is called your Line Card. This is what you sell “every day.”

• Specialty hardware, software, and materials. These are low- volume sales that you have the opportunity to sell.

• Managed Service . This is labor sold as blocks of time or as flat-rate monthly services.

• Hourly labor or project labor sold outside the managed service contract.

• Cloud services, including virtualization, hosting, remote backup, etc.

• Specialty products and services. This category includes customized software, specific line of business applications for which you are a reseller, telephone systems and services, etc

Have a basis of what you sell  (Line card)
- Hardware, Software,Materials.


#### **Special Order HW SW MATS**

20% upcharge
have skills to install

upcharge is insurance on getting the right thing

#### Hourly labor
Hourly labor is easily divided into projects and break/fix.

Hourly break/fix labor happens even with clients under managed service. Adds, moves, and changes (AMC) are not covered. So if someone wants a program installed, that’s billable.

Hourly Labor can come part of the package at a cheaper rate but once they use their hours they get upcharged 

### Specialty Products and Services


the more time, effort, and money you need to invest in order to support it, the more money you will make. If you have a specific niche market (or two), then a high level of training in those software packages can be very profitable.

This is something like the smsturbo software in QCD

### Cloud Services
### Managed service

## BDR and backup

backup and disaster recovery

Clients Aren’t Stupid – But They Are Uneducated

educate them on why a backup is essential and maintanace is needed on it

three options for backup:  
1) Old school disc or tape. Onsite but rotated offsite. 
2) BDR onsite backed up to the cloud  
3) Simple backup to hosted cloud storage.

find your selling point
like no more than 1 hr of downtime after critical failure


## VOIP, Signage, Security, and More

TCP/IP is taking over so learning how to deal with IP services and IOT devices will be key



# Putting Your (New) Business Together

## Weed Your Client Garden and Finish The Plan

- Meaning draw some lines, set some rules and possibly drop some clients
1. Cut off any unwanted clients
2. make 3 sets of lists, Platnum ,gold, silver.
3. finialize the plan
