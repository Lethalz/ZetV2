# Ultralearning

Learning hard things fast is a skill in itself but the more hard things you learn is the more transferrable your study skills become.

1.  **Metalearning:** First draw a map
2.  **Focus:**  Develop concentration and allocate time
3.  **Directness:** Learn by doing
4.  **Drill:** Attack your weakest point 
5.  **Retrieval:** Test to learn
6.  **Feedback:** Don’t dodge the punches
7.  **Retention:** Pace yourself for better retention
8.  **Intuition:** Develop intuition through play and exploration
9.  **Experimentation:** Explore outside your comfort zone

## Principle 1 – Metalearning

Before starting any project ask yourself "Why, What, How"
- Create a map of the thing you are trying to learn
- Concepts, Facts and Procedures 
- Understand the Concepts
- Memorize the Facts
- Execute the procedures

-   “Why?” – uncovers the actual motivation to learn. 
-   “What?” – identify knowledge and skills that needs to be acquired to achieve results.(Concepts, Facts and Procedures )
-   “How?” – assemble the resource, environment and methods needed to learn.(Benchmarking, emphasize / exclude)


Spend 10% of total time alotted to research
- "Analysis Paralysis"
- Also to not just pick the first resource you come across.

Try actively  engaging with the material by asking and answering questionsw. This helps you to identify what you don't know, and to reinforce what you do know.

## Principle 2 – Focus: Sharpen your saw
Find your way to focus.

3 Focus Problems
1. Failing to start focus - Recognize the uncomfortable feeling is your brain hating new things and that feeling will go away fairly quickly.
2. Failing to sustain focus - Try and cover multiple topics in one day instead of doing one deeply. Let inner thoughts flow through you and realize that your mind will never be satisfied. [[The untethered Soul#^3ef9a2]]
3. Failing to do the correct focus - Complex tasks benefit from lower arousal and quieter environments, while simpler tasks benefit from a noisier one.

[[The five minute rule]]  Helps here, if you can do something in under 5 minutes do it!


## Principle 3 – Directness
"Ideas without action are worthless." - Harvey Mackay

"The greatest teacher, failure is." - Yoda
![[Yoda_Empire_Strikes_Back.png]]


School as we know it is indirect, there were so many times i tried to start college just to be railroaded by work that i did not want to do because that wasn't what i was there for.
Just because you play brain training games doesn't mean that will "transfer" to other skills.
The only thing that is proven to work 100% of the time is actually “doing” what you want to learn.

If you can't actually do the activity, mimic it as closely as possible. 

Project-based learning is the best way to learn

Ask yourself where and how the knowledge will manifest itself when reading and listening to lectures. Dig deeper in topics you are particularly interested in. Find applicable uses for things you learn as you learn them.

## Principle 4 - Drill

![[index.jpg]]

"Problems do not go away. They must be worked through or else they remain, forever a barrier to the growth and development of the spirit." 

You know that thing you tried to do, but it was harder than everything else? Yeah.. do that again. 
You are only as strong as your weakest link is the key here. Even though drilling your hardest tasks might slow you down. 
Sometime you need to slow down to move faster later.
This is kinda like me drilling the "accountant" mode on [monkeytype](monkeytype.com) because i knew numbers were my weakness.

The key to drilling is knowing why you are doing said drill. It will push you to keep going through the dril knowing specially how you will be better in the future.


- Start on the Project then when you get stuck refer to the lectures
- In music, it's like practicing with the metronome [[Practicing with a metronome]] and playing the hardest part of the song
- Slow things down for increased focus, comprehension, problem solving and reduced stress.

## Principle 5 - Retrieval

When going back to verify knowledge DO NOT go abck and read notes,
This can give you a flase sense of confidence of course you will know more if you are looking exactly at what you wrote down.
Instead practice a retrieval method whether thats just thinking about what you learning previously or using spaced repition software like anki you need to practice "Active Recall" instead of confimation bias from looking at your notes

5 methods

1. Flashcards (anki)
2. Free recall - Write down as much stuff that you can remember
3. Questions instead of notes - write big picture questions in your notes i.e  How does applying VLANs to my network incrase security?
4. Self-generated challenges
5. Taking practice tests without cheet sheet

## Principle 6 - Feedback

Rapid feedback is important allows the learner to better judge their approach
Feedback works well when it gives useful information to guide future learning and is actionable.

3 Levels of feedback

1. Outcome Feedback - Tells you how well you did overrall think conventional school grading
2. Information Feedback - Tells you when you are wrong but not how to fix it
3. Corrective Feedback - Tells you when you're wrong but also **why** and how to fix it.

```ad-warning
too quick of feedback may turn retrieval practice into a passive review, so for example when encountering hard problems, give yourself a time limit before looking up the answer.
```

Don't be a biatch and take criticism. But do understand that not all criticism is good. Know when to block out the bullshit and go with your gut.


## Principle 7 – Retension

Mnemonics, or anything that allows humans to “chunk” related ideas together into one memorable phrase or picture, is the most effective way to remember lots of things at once.

Not all of us have the gift of having photographic memory
Everything you learn will start to decay to make space for new information think of this as our RAM.
To counter this _proceduralization_ needs to be practiced, it's like typing and learning the mucsle memory to know where every key is. 
You want to learn concepts to the point where they become second nature by practicing.

3 ways

- Build mind maps of though to organize your ideas
- Try and recall things that you've learned while doing other menial tasks
- never cram just understand

## Principle 8 - Intuition 

Relation is intution. 
How to build intuition
1. Don't give up on hard tasks
2. FOCUS on real world applications
3. Deliberate reflection - always be thinking about sucesses and failures to develop a better understanding of your strengths and weaknesses
4. Use mental models to better understand complex topics
5. Dont fool yourself - there is always more you can learn and unlearn always be looking for new info
6. Always start with a concrete example - new concepts are hard to learn abstractly, try to tie concepts with deeper processing of the meaning such as its pleasantness rather than a trivial meaning like its spelling

Use the Feynman technique - which is just trying to explain advanced topics in the simpliest way possible or explain how to solve a problem and why each step makes sense

If at any point you are stuck, only then do you refer back to notes or lectures (similar to free recall).

This technique can be applied to things you don’t understand at all **(break it down** to understanding just once sentence if necessary), problems you can’t seem to solve (step through the problem in detail and understanding why each step is performed rather than memorizing steps) and expanding intuition (generate visualizations, analogies, and diagrams, explain as if you are being paid to write an article about the idea). ^9eacc9


Principle 9 - Experimentation

Experimentation = Mastery

Try different 
- Learning techniques
- styles'
- resources

Don't just solve promblems others have but solve ones they have not

1. Copy then create - I've done this while making music, see what the succesful people have done and emulate that but put your own spin on it and othes probably wont even hear the similarit
2. compare different methods of learning, whether thats videos, flashcards, or mnomnics
3. Dont be afraid to explore the extremes (Press that red button see what happens!)
4. combine unrelated skills, marketing and  programming, networking and project management


We do all this for expeirence with what methods, tools or procedures are sucessful or unseccessful


wwask and answer questions about the subject, and to understand why the correct answers are correct and why the incorrect answers are incorrect. This approach can help you identify knowledge gaps and improve your ability to learn and retain information.
