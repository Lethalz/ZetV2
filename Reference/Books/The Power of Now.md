## **A Guide to Spiritual Enlightenment: _The Power of Now_ by Eckhart Tolle (Book Summary)**

### **Eckhart Tolle’s Spiritual Transformation**

“Until my **thirtieth year**, I lived in a state of almost **continuous anxiety interspersed with periods of suicidal depression**. It feels now as if I am talking about some past lifetime or somebody else’s life.”

- “One night not long after my twenty-ninth birthday, I woke up in the early hours with a feeling of absolute dread.”
- “**‘I cannot live with myself any longer.’** This was the thought that kept repeating itself in my mind. Then suddenly I became aware of what a peculiar thought it was. **‘Am I one or two? If I cannot live with myself, there must be two of me: the ‘I’ and the ‘self’ that ‘I’ cannot live with.’** ‘Maybe,’ I thought, ‘only one of them is real.'”
- “**For the next five months, I lived in a state of uninterrupted deep peace and bliss.** After that, it diminished somewhat in intensity, or perhaps it just seemed to because it became my natural state. I could still function in the world, although **I realized that nothing I ever _did_ could possibly add anything to what I already had**.”
- “I knew, of course, that something profoundly significant had happened to me, but I didn’t understand it at all. It wasn’t until several years later, after I had read spiritual texts and spent time with spiritual teachers, that I realized that what everybody was looking for had already happened to me. **I understood that the intense pressure of suffering that night must have forced my consciousness to withdraw from its identification with the unhappy and deeply fearful self, which is ultimately a fiction of the mind.**“
- “What was left then was my **true nature as the ever-present _I am_**_:_ consciousness in its pure state prior to identification with form.”
- “A time came when, for a while, I was left with nothing on the physical plane. I had no relationships, no job, no home, no socially defined identity. **I spent almost two years sitting on park benches in a state of the most intense joy.**“

### **Introduction to _The Power of Now_**

“I trust that this book will find its way to **those who are ready for such radical inner transformation** and so act as a catalyst for it. I also hope that it will reach many others who will find its content worthy of consideration, although they may not be ready to fully live or practice it. It is possible that at a later time, **the seed that was sown when reading this book will merge with the seed of enlightenment that each human being carries within**, and suddenly that seed will sprout and come alive within them.”

- “**This book can be seen as a restatement for our time of that one timeless spiritual teaching, the essence of all religions.** It is not derived from external sources, but from the one true Source within, so it contains no theory or speculation.”
- “**I cannot tell you any spiritual truth that deep within you don’t know already. All I can do is remind you of what you have forgotten.** Living knowledge, ancient and yet ever new, is then activated and released from within every cell of your body.”
- “**There is no need to go elsewhere for the truth.** Let me show you how to go more deeply into what you already have.”
- “**On one level, I draw your attention to what is _false_ in you.** I speak of the nature of human unconsciousness and dysfunction as well as its most common behavioral manifestations, from conflict in relationships to warfare between tribes or nations. Such knowledge is vital, for unless you learn to recognize the false as false – as not you – there can be no lasting transformation, and you would always end up being drawn back into illusion and into some form of pain. **On this level, I also show you how not to make that which is false in you into a self and into a personal problem, for that is how the false perpetuates itself.**“
- “**On another level, I speak of a profound transformation of human consciousness** – not as a distant future possibility, but available now – no matter who or where you are. You are shown how to free yourself from enslavement to the mind, enter into this enlightened state of consciousness and sustain it in everyday life.”

### **Humanity’s Current Crisis & Consciousness Evolution**

“Egoic mind has become like a sinking ship. If you don’t get off, you will go down with it. **The collective egoic mind is the most dangerously insane and destructive entity ever to inhabit this planet.** What do you think will happen on this planet if human consciousness remains unchanged?”

- “**The world as it appears to us now is largely a reflection of the egoic mind.** Fear being an unavoidable consequence of egoic delusion, it is a world dominated by fear.”
- “As the egoic mode of consciousness and all the social, political, and economic structures that it created **enter the final stage of collapse**, the relationships between men and women reflect the **deep state of crisis in which humanity now finds itself**.”
- “**Humanity is under great pressure to evolve because it is our only chance of survival as a race.** This will affect every aspect of your life and close relationships in particular.”

**Today, few humans have gone beyond mind:**

- “**Those who run on mind energy, which is still the vast majority of the Earth’s population, remain unaware of the existence of spiritual energy.** It belongs to a different order of reality and will create a different world when a sufficient number of humans enter the surrendered state and so become totally free of negativity. If the Earth is to survive, this will be the energy of those who inhabit it.”
- “**Most humans are completely unconscious of this dimension.**” (of inner space and inner silence)
- “**The number of people who have gone beyond mind is as yet extremely small**, so you can assume that virtually everyone you meet or know lives in a state of fear. Only the intensity of it varies.”

**Compulsive thinking is an addiction and disease:**

- “It is not so much that you use your mind wrongly – you usually don’t use it at all. It uses _you._ This is the disease. **You believe that you _are_ your mind. This is the delusion.**“
- “**Identification with your mind, which causes thought to become compulsive.** Not to be able to stop thinking is a dreadful affliction, but we don’t realize this because almost everybody is suffering from it, so it is considered normal. This incessant mental noise prevents you from finding that realm of inner stillness that is inseparable from Being. It also **creates a false mind-made self that casts a shadow of fear and suffering**.”
- “**The mind-identified state is severely dysfunctional. It is a form of insanity.** Almost everyone is suffering from this illness in varying degrees. The moment you realize this, there can be no more resentment. How can you resent someone’s illness? **The only appropriate response is compassion.**“
- “**Compulsive thinking has become a collective disease.**“
- “**Compulsive thinking is actually an addiction.** What characterizes an addiction? Quite simply this: you no longer feel that you have the choice to stop. It seems stronger than you. It also gives you a false sense of pleasure, pleasure that invariably turns into pain.”

**Unconsciousness:**

- “‘Unconscious,’ the way that I use the word here, means to be **identified with some mental or emotional pattern**.”
- “What I call **ordinary unconsciousness means being identified with your thought processes and emotions, your reactions, desires, and aversions**. It is most people’s normal state.”
- “The basic mechanics of the unconscious state: **identification with the mind, which creates a false self, the ego, as a substitute for your true self rooted in Being**.”
- “**If mental development and increased knowledge are not counterbalanced by a corresponding growth in consciousness**, the potential for unhappiness and disaster is very great.”
- “**All evils are the _effect_ of unconsciousness.** You can alleviate the effects of unconsciousness, but you cannot eliminate them unless you eliminate their cause. True change happens within, not without.”
- “**Choice implies consciousness – a high degree of consciousness. Without it, you have no choice.** Choice begins the moment you disidentify from the mind and its conditioned patterns, the moment you become present. **Until you reach that point, you are unconscious**.”
- “**Anything unconscious dissolves when you shine the light of consciousness on it.**“

**Humanity’s Shift in Consciousness:**

- “The predominance of mind is no more than a stage in the evolution of consciousness. **We need to go on to the next stage now as a matter of urgency, otherwise, we will be destroyed by the mind**.”
- “What is needed and what we are concerned with is a **permanent shift in consciousness**.”
- “We are not separate from our world, so **when the majority of humans become free of egoic delusion, this inner change will _affect_ all of creation**. You will literally inhabit a new world. It is a **shift in planetary consciousness**.”
- “What is being born is a **new consciousness** and, as its inevitable reflection, a **new world**.”
- “Are you polluting the world or cleaning up the mess? You are responsible for your inner space; nobody else is, just as you are responsible for the planet. As within, so without: **If humans clear inner pollution, then they will also cease to create outer pollution.**“
- “**Only those who have transcended the world can bring about a better world.**“
- “**You become the ‘light of the world,’** an emanation of pure consciousness, and so you eliminate suffering on the level of cause. You eliminate unconsciousness from the world.”
- “**The causal level needs to remain your primary focus**, the teaching of enlightenment your main purpose, and peace your most precious gift to the world.”
- “**Who you _are_ is always a more vital teaching and a more powerful transformer of the world than what you say, and more essential even than what you do.**“

### **Ego, Mind, & Emotions**

“You derive your sense of self from the content and activity of your mind. Because you believe that you would cease to be if you stopped thinking. As you grow up, you form a mental image of who you are, based on your personal and cultural conditioning. **We may call this phantom self the ego.** It consists of **mind activity** and can only be kept going through **constant thinking**.”

**Ego:**

- “The term **ego** means different things to different people, but when I use it here it means a **false self, created by unconscious identification with the mind**.”
- “**As long as you are identified with your mind, the ego runs your life.** Another aspect of the emotional pain that is an intrinsic part of the egoic mind is a **deep-seated sense of lack or incompleteness, of not being whole.**“
- “Since the **ego is a derived sense of self**, it needs to identify with external things. It needs to be both defended and fed constantly. The **most common ego identifications** have to do with possessions, the work you do, social status and recognition, knowledge and education, physical appearance, special abilities, relationships, personal and family history, belief systems, and often also political, nationalistic, racial, religious, and other collective identifications. **None of these is you.**“
- “**As long as you are identified with the mind, you have an externally derived sense of self.** That is to say, you get your sense of who you are from things that ultimately have nothing to do with who you are: your social role, possessions, external appearance, successes and failures, belief systems, and so on.”
- “**Separation is the basis for the ego’s sense of identity.**“
- “**Ego is the unobserved mind that runs your life when you are not present as the witnessing consciousness, the watcher.** The ego perceives itself as a separate fragment in a hostile universe, with no real inner connection to any other being, surrounded by other egos which it either sees as a potential threat or which it will attempt to use for its own ends. The basic ego patterns are designed to combat its own deep-seated fear and sense of lack. They are resistance, control, power, greed, defense, attack. Some of the ego’s strategies are extremely clever, yet they never truly solve any of its problems, simply because the ego itself is the problem.”
- “**Identification with your mind creates an opaque screen of concepts, labels, images, words, judgments, and definitions** that blocks all true relationship. It comes between you and yourself, between you and your fellow man and woman, between you and nature, between you and God. It is this **screen of thought that creates the illusion of separateness, the illusion that there is _you and_ a totally separate ‘other.’** You then forget the essential fact that, underneath the level of physical appearances and separate forms, you are one with all that is.”

**Mind & Emotions:**

- “**The mind is essentially a survival machine.** Attack and defense against other minds, gathering, storing, and analyzing information – this is what it is good at, but it is not at all creative.”
- “**Your mind is an instrument, a tool.** It is there to be used for a specific task, and when the task is completed, you lay it down.”
- “**The mind in itself is not dysfunctional. It is a wonderful tool.** Dysfunction sets in when you seek your self in it and mistake it for who you are. It then becomes the _egoic_ mind and takes over your whole life.”
- “It wasn’t through the mind, through thinking, that the miracle that is life on earth or your body were created and are being sustained. **There is clearly an intelligence at work that is far greater than the mind.**“
- “**Mind, in the way I use the word, is not just thought. It includes your emotions as well as all unconscious mental-emotional reactive patterns.** Emotion arises at the place where mind and body meet. It is the body’s reaction to your mind – or you might say, a reflection of your mind in the body.”
- “**The mind cannot know the tree. It can only know facts or information _about_ the tree.** My mind cannot know you, only labels, judgments, facts, and opinions _about you._ Being alone knows directly.”
- “**Often a vicious circle builds up between your thinking and the emotion: they feed each other.** The thought pattern creates a magnified reflection of itself in the form of an emotion, and the vibrational frequency of the emotion keeps feeding the original thought pattern. By dwelling mentally on the situation, event, or person that is the perceived cause of the emotion, the thought feeds energy to the emotion, which in turn energizes the thought pattern, and so on.”
- “The mind can never find the solution, nor can it afford to allow you to find the solution, because **it is itself an intrinsic part of the ‘problem.’**“
- “**The problems of the mind cannot be solved on the level of the mind.**“

**Pain:**

- “**Pain is inevitable as long as you are identified with your mind**, which is to say as long as you are unconscious, spiritually speaking.”
- “You will not be free of that pain until you **cease to derive your sense of self from identification with the mind**, which is to say from ego. The mind is then toppled from its place of power and Being reveals itself as your true nature.”
- “**The harder the mind struggles to get rid of the pain, the greater the pain.**“
- “**The pain that you create now is always some form of nonacceptance**, some form of unconscious resistance to what is. On the level of thought, the resistance is some form of judgment. On the emotional level, it is some form of negativity.”
- “**The more you are identified with your mind, the more you suffer.** Or you may put it like this: the more you are able to honor and accept the Now, the more ore you are free of pain, of suffering – and free of the egoic mind.”
- “**The pain-body, which is the dark shadow cast by the ego, is actually afraid of the light of your consciousness**. It is afraid of being found out. Its survival depends on your unconscious identification with it, as well as on your unconscious fear of facing the pain that lives in you.”
- “As humans have become increasingly identified with their mind, most relationships are not rooted in Being and so turn into a **source of pain and become dominated by problems and conflict**.”
- “**Some spiritual teachings state that all pain is ultimately an illusion**, and this is true. The question is: Is it true for you?”
- “**Are you defending your right to be unconscious, your right to suffer?** Don’t worry. Nobody is going to take that away from you. Once you realize that a certain kind of food makes you sick, would you carry on eating that food and keep asserting that it is okay to be sick?”

### **Life Situation vs Life / Outer Purpose vs Inner Purpose**

“When the compulsive striving away from the Now ceases, the joy of Being flows into everything you do. The moment your attention turns to the Now, you feel a presence, a stillness, a peace. You no longer depend on the future for fulfillment and satisfaction – you don’t look to it for salvation. Therefore, you are not attached to the results. Neither failure nor success has the power to change your inner state of Being. **You have found the life underneath your life situation.**“

**Life Situation vs Life:**

- “Whenever you can, make some room, create some space, so that you **find the life underneath your life situation**.”
- “Your life situation exists in time. **Your life is now.** Your life situation is mind-stuff. **Your life is real.**“
- “You can improve your life situation, but **you cannot improve your life**. **Life is primary.** **Life is your deepest inner Being. It is already whole, complete, perfect.** Your life situation consists of your circumstances and your experiences. There is nothing wrong with setting goals and striving to achieve things. The mistake lies in using it as a substitute for the feeling of life, for Being.”

**Outer Purpose vs Inner Purpose:**

- “**Your life’s journey has an outer purpose and an inner purpose.** The outer purpose is to arrive at your goal or destination, to accomplish what you set out to do, to achieve this or that, which, of course, implies future. But if your destination, or the steps you are going to take in the future, take up so much of your attention that they become more important to you than the step you are taking now, then you completely miss the journeys inner purpose, which has nothing to do with _where you_ are going or _what you_ are doing, but **everything to do with _how_**_._ **It has nothing to do with future but everything to do with the quality of your consciousness at this moment.**“
- “The outer purpose belongs to the horizontal dimension of space and time; the **inner purpose concerns a deepening of your Being in the vertical dimension of the timeless Now**. Your outer journey may contain a million steps; your **inner journey only has one: the step you are taking right now**. As you become more deeply aware of this one step, you realize that it already contains within itself all the other steps as well as the destination. This one step then becomes transformed into an expression of perfection, an act of great beauty and quality. It will have taken you into Being, and the light of Being will shine through it. **This is both the purpose and the fulfillment of your inner journey, the journey into yourself.**“
- “The sooner you realize that your outer purpose cannot give you lasting fulfillment, the better. When you have seen the limitations of your outer purpose, you give up your unrealistic expectation that it should make you happy, and you **make it subservient to your inner purpose**.”
- “**The ultimate purpose of the world lies not within the world but in transcendence of the world.** Just as you would not be conscious of space if there were no objects in space, the world is needed for the Unmanifested to be realized. You may have heard the Buddhist saying: ‘If there were no illusion, there would be no enlightenment.’ It is through the world and ultimately through you that the Unmanifested knows itself. **You are here to enable the divine purpose of the universe to unfold. _That is how important you are!_**“

### **Acceptance & Surrender**

“**Surrender is the simple but profound wisdom of _yielding to_ rather than _opposing_ the _flow_ of life.** The only place where you can experience the _flow_ of life is the Now, so to surrender is to **accept the present moment unconditionally** and without reservation. It is to relinquish inner resistance to what is. Inner resistance is to say ‘no’ to what is, through mental judgment and emotional negativity.”

**Accept what is:**

- “Accept – then act. **Whatever the present moment contains, accept it as if you had chosen it.** Always work with it, not against it. Make it your friend and ally, not your enemy. This will miraculously transform your whole life.”
- “Do what you have to do. **In the meantime, accept what is**.”
- “**‘Accept whatever comes to you woven in the pattern of your destiny, for what could more aptly fit your needs?’** This was written 2,000 years ago by Marcus Aurelius, one of those exceedingly rare humans who possessed worldly power as well as wisdom.”
- “Ultimately, this is not about solving your problems. It’s about realizing that there _are_ no problems. Only situations – to be dealt with now, or to be left alone and accepted as part of the ‘isness’ of the present moment until they change or _can_ be dealt with. **Problems are mind-made and need time to survive. They cannot survive in the actuality of the Now.**“
- “**Acceptance of what is immediately frees you from mind identification** and thus reconnects you with Being. Resistance is the mind.”
- “**Attention is the key to transformation – and full attention also implies acceptance.** Attention is like a beam of light – the focused power of your consciousness that transmutes everything into itself.”
- “**Full attention is full acceptance, is surrender.**“
- “**The moment you _completely_ accept** your non-peace, your non-peace becomes transmuted into peace. Anything you **accept fully** will get you there, will take you into peace. **This is the miracle of surrender.**“

**Surrender:**

- “**Surrender to what is. Say ‘yes’ to life – and see how life suddenly starts working _for you_ rather than against you.**“
- “It is the quality of your consciousness at this moment that is the main determinant of what kind of future you will experience, so **to surrender is the most important thing you can do to bring about positive change**. Any action you take is secondary. No truly positive action can arise out of an unsurrendered state of consciousness.”
- “**Through surrender, spiritual energy comes into this world.** It creates no suffering for yourself, for other humans, or any other life form on the planet.”
- “**Surrender is a purely inner phenomenon.** It does not mean that on the outer level you cannot take action and change the situation.”
- “**Surrender is perfectly compatible with taking action**, initiating change or achieving goals. But in the surrendered state a totally different energy, a different quality, flows into your doing. **Surrender reconnects you with the source-energy of Being**, and if your doing is infused with Being, it becomes a joyful celebration of life energy that takes you more deeply into the Now.”
- “Through nonresistance, the quality of your consciousness and, therefore, the quality of whatever you are doing or creating is enhanced immeasurably. The results will then look after themselves and reflect that quality. **We could call this ‘surrendered action.’**“
- “**Surrender – the letting go of mental-emotional resistance to what is – also becomes a portal into the Unmanifested.** The reason for this is simple: inner resistance cuts you off from other people, from yourself, from the world around you.”
- “Until you practice surrender, the spiritual dimension is something you read about, talk about, get excited about, write books about, think about, believe in – or don’t, as the case may be. It makes no difference. **Not until you surrender does it become a living reality in your life.**“
- “**Surrender does not transform what is, at least not directly. Surrender transforms _you_.** When _you_ are transformed, your whole world is transformed, because the world is only a reflection.”
- “Since resistance is inseparable from the mind, relinquishment of resistance – **surrender – is the end of the mind as your master**, the impostor pretending to be ‘you,’ the false god. All judgment and all negativity dissolve. The realm of Being, which had been obscured by the mind, then opens up. Suddenly, a great stillness arises within you, an unfathomable sense of peace. And within that peace, there is great joy. And within that joy, there is love. And at the innermost core, there is the sacred, the immeasurable, **That** which cannot be named.”

### **Now — The Present Moment**

“What is the power of Now? None other than **the power of your presence, your consciousness liberated from thought forms**.”

**The delusion of time:**

- “Ultimately, there is **only one problem: the timebound mind itself**.”
- “**You cannot be both unhappy _and_ fully present** in the Now.”
- “**Suffering needs time**; it cannot survive in the Now.”
- “End the delusion of time. **Time and mind are inseparable.** Remove time from the mind and it stops – unless you choose to use it.”

**Clock time & psychological time:**

- “Learn to **use time in the practical aspects of your life – we may call this ‘clock time’** – but immediately return to present-moment awareness when those practical matters have been dealt with. In this way, there will be no build-up of **‘psychological time,’ which is identification with the past and continuous compulsive projection into the future**.”
- “The enlightened persons main focus of attention is always the Now, but they are still peripherally aware of time. In other words, they **continue to use clock time but are free of psychological time**.”
- “**To be free of time is to be free of the psychological need of past for your identity and future for your fulfillment.** It represents the most profound transformation of consciousness that you can imagine.”
- “**All negativity is caused by an accumulation of psychological time and denial of the present.** Unease, anxiety, tension, stress, worry – all forms of fear – are caused by too much future, and not enough presence. Guilt, regret, resentment, grievances, sadness, bitterness, and all forms of nonforgiveness are caused by **too much past, and not enough presence**.”

**Past & Future:**

- “**To be identified with your mind is to be trapped in time: the compulsion to live almost exclusively through memory and anticipation.** This creates an endless preoccupation with past and future and an unwillingness to honor and acknowledge the present moment and _allow it to be._ The compulsion arises because the past gives you an identity and the future holds the promise of salvation, of fulfillment in whatever form. Both are illusions.”
- “**Nothing ever happened in the past; it happened in the Now. Nothing will ever happen in the future; it will happen in the Now.** What you think of as the **past is a memory trace**, stored in the mind, of **a former Now**. When you remember the past, you reactivate a memory trace – and you do so now. The **future is an imagined Now**, a projection of the mind. When the future comes, it comes as the Now. When you think about the future, you do it now. **Past and future obviously have no reality of their own … Their reality is ‘borrowed’ from the Now**.”
- “Realize deeply that **the present moment is all you ever have**. Make the Now the primary focus of your life. Whereas before you dwelt in time and paid brief visits to the Now, have your dwelling place in the Now and pay brief visits to past and future when required to deal with the practical aspects of your life situation.”
- “**Die to the past every moment.** You don’t need it. Only refer to it when it is absolutely relevant to the present.”
- “**The quality of your consciousness at this moment is what shapes the future** – which, of course, can only be experienced as the Now.”
- “If it is the quality of your consciousness at this moment that determines the future, then **what is it that determines the quality of your consciousness? Your degree of presence**.”

**The Present:**

- “Since ancient times, spiritual masters of all traditions have pointed to **the Now as the key to the spiritual dimension**. Despite this, it seems to have remained a secret.”
- “Instead of ‘watching the thinker,’ you can also **create a gap in the mind stream simply by directing the focus of your attention into the Now**. Just become intensely conscious of the present moment. This is a deeply satisfying thing to do. In this way, you draw consciousness away from mind activity and create a gap of no-mind in which you are highly alert and aware but not thinking. **This is the essence of meditation.**“
- “Once you recognize the root of unconsciousness as identification with the mind, which of course includes the emotions, you step out of it. **You become _present._**When you are present, you can allow the mind to be as it is without getting entangled in it.”
- “Let me say it again: **the present moment is all you ever have**. There is never a time when your life is not ‘this moment.'”
- “**Gratitude for the present moment and the fullness of life now is true prosperity.**“
- “Why is it the most precious thing? Firstly, because **it is the _only_ thing**. It’s all there is. The eternal present is the space within which your whole life unfolds, the one factor that remains constant. **Life is now.** There was never a time when your life was _not_ now, nor will there ever be. Secondly, **the Now is the only point that can take you beyond the limited confines of the mind**. It is your only point of access into the timeless and formless realm of Being.”
- “**The Now, of course, also implies the here.** Are you resisting your here and now? Some people would always rather be somewhere else. Their ‘here’ is never good enough. Through self-observation, find out if that is the case in your life. Wherever you are, be there totally.”

**Presence:**

- “The pain-body doesn’t want you to observe it directly and see it for what it is. The moment you observe it, feel its energy field within you, and take your attention into it, **the identification is broken. A higher dimension of consciousness has come in. I call it _presence._** You are now the witness or the watcher of the pain-body. This means that it cannot use you anymore by pretending to be you, and it can no longer replenish itself through you. You have found your own innermost strength. **You have accessed the power of Now.**“
- “When you become conscious of Being, what is really happening is that Being becomes conscious of itself. **When Being becomes conscious of itself – that’s presence.** Since Being, Consciousness, and Life are synonymous, we could say that **presence means consciousness becoming conscious of itself, or life attaining self-consciousness**.”
- “When consciousness frees itself from its identification with physical and mental forms, it becomes what we may call **pure or enlightened consciousness, or presence**.”
- “**Presence is pure consciousness** – consciousness that has been reclaimed from the mind, from the world of form.”
- “**It’s not what you think it is!** You cant think about presence, and the mind can’t understand it. **Understanding presence is _being_ present.**“
- “When you are intensely _present, you_ don’t need to be concerned about the cessation of thinking, of course, because **the mind then stops automatically**.”

### ****Watching the Thinker****

“Start listening to the voice in your head as often as you can. Pay particular attention to any repetitive thought patterns … This is what I mean by **‘watching the thinker,’** which is another way of saying: **listen to the voice in your head, _be_ there as the witnessing presence**.”

- “The mind is using you. You are unconsciously identified with it, so you don’t even know that you are its slave. It’s almost as if you were possessed without knowing it, and so you take the possessing entity to be yourself. **The beginning of freedom is the realization that you are not the possessing entity – the thinker.** Knowing this enables you to observe the entity. **The moment you start _watching the thinker_, a higher level of consciousness becomes activated.**“
- “By watching the mechanics of the mind, **you step out of its resistance patterns, and you can then _allow the present moment to be_**_._ This will give you a taste of the state of inner freedom from external conditions, the state of true inner peace. Then see what happens, and take action if necessary or possible.”
- “**You’ll soon realize: _there is_ the voice, and here _I am_ listening to it, watching it.** This I _am_ realization, this sense of your own presence, is not a thought. It arises from beyond the mind.”
- “So when you listen to a thought, you are **aware not only of the thought but also of yourself as the witness of the thought**.”
- “The thought then loses its power over you and quickly subsides, because you are no longer energizing the mind through identification with it. **This is the beginning of the end of involuntary and compulsive thinking.**“
- “Identification with the mind gives it more energy, **observation of the mind withdraws energy from it**. Identification with the mind creates more time; **observation of the mind opens up the dimension of the timeless**.”
- “Whenever you watch the mind, you withdraw consciousness from mind forms, which then becomes what we call the **watcher or the witness**. Consequently, the **watcher – pure consciousness beyond form** – becomes stronger, and the mental formations become weaker.”
- “**To disidentify from thinking is to be the silent watcher of your thoughts and behavior**, especially the repetitive patterns of your mind and the roles played by the ego.”
- “When you listen to that voice, **listen to it impartially**. That is to say, **do not judge**.”
- “You are not usually conscious of all your thought patterns, and it is **often only through watching your emotions that you can bring them into awareness**.”
- “If you have difficulty feeling your emotions, **start by focusing attention on the inner energy field of your body**. Feel the body from within. This will also put you in touch with your emotions.”

**No-Mind:**

- “**When a thought subsides, you experience a discontinuity in the mental stream – a gap of ‘no-mind.’** At first, the gaps will be short, a few seconds perhaps, but gradually they will become longer. When these gaps occur, you feel a certain stillness and peace inside you. This is the beginning of your natural state of felt oneness with Being, which is usually obscured by the mind.”
- “As you go more deeply into this realm of no-mind, as it is sometimes called in the East, **you realize the state of pure consciousness**. In that state, you feel your own presence with such intensity and such joy that all thinking, all emotions, your physical body, as well as the whole external world become relatively insignificant in comparison to it. And yet this is not a selfish but a selfless state. **It takes you beyond what you previously thought of as ‘your self.’** That presence is essentially you and at the same time inconceivably greater than you.”
- “**No-mind is consciousness without thought.**“
- “**The wider the time gap between perception and thought, the more depth there is to you as a human being, which is to say the more conscious you are.**“

### **Being & Love**

“**Being is the eternal, ever-present One Life beyond the myriad forms of life** that are subject to birth and death. However, Being is not only beyond but also **deep within every form as its innermost invisible and indestructible essence**. This means that it is **accessible to you now** as your own deepest self, your true nature.”

**Being:**

- “Don’t seek to grasp it with your mind. Don’t try to understand it. **You can know it only when the mind is still.** When you are present, when your attention is fully and intensely in the Now, **Being can be felt, but it can never be understood mentally**. To regain awareness of Being and to abide in that **state of ‘feeling-realization’** is enlightenment.”
- “The word _Unmanifested_ attempts, by way of negation, to express That which cannot be spoken, thought or imagined. It points to what it is by saying what it is not … **_Being_, on the other hand, is a positive term.** Please don’t get attached to either of these words or start believing in them. They are no more than signposts.”
- “Being can be **_felt_ as the ever-present _I am_ that is beyond name and form**. To feel and thus to know that you _are_ and to abide in that deeply rooted state is enlightenment.”
- “Nobody can claim exclusive possession of Being. It is **your very essence**, and it is immediately accessible to you as the feeling of your own presence, the **realization I _am_ that is prior to I am this or I am that**.”
- “**Loss of Now is loss of Being.**“
- “In Being, **subject and object merge into one**.”
- “Make it a habit to **ask yourself ‘What’s going on inside me at this moment?’** That question will point you in the right direction. But don’t analyze, just watch. Focus your attention within. Feel the energy of the emotion. If there is no emotion present, take your attention more deeply into the inner energy field of your body. It is **the doorway into Being**.”
- “To become conscious of Being, you need to **reclaim consciousness from the mind**. This is one of the most essential tasks on your spiritual journey.”
- “To go beyond the mind and reconnect with the deeper reality of Being, very different qualities are needed: **surrender**, **nonjudgment**, an **openness** that allows life to be instead of resisting it, the capacity to hold all things in the **loving embrace** of your **knowing**.”
- “Whereas mind-energy is hard and rigid, **Being-energy is soft and yielding and yet infinitely more powerful than mind**. The mind runs our civilization, whereas Being is in charge of all life on our planet and beyond. Being is the very Intelligence whose visible manifestation is the physical universe.”
- “Joy is uncaused and arises from within as the **joy of Being**.”
- “At the level of Being, **all suffering is recognized as an illusion**. Suffering is due to identification with form.”
- “Remember that **your perception of the world is a reflection of your state of consciousness**. You are not separate from it, and there is no objective world out there. Every moment, **your consciousness creates the world that you inhabit**.”

**Love:**

- “In the stillness of your presence, you can feel your own formless and timeless reality as the unmanifested life that animates your physical form. You can then feel the same life deep within every other human and every other creature. You look beyond the veil of form and separation. This is the realization of oneness. **This is love.**“
- “You cannot feel someone else’s Being except through your own. This is the beginning of the **realization of oneness, which is love**. At the deepest level of Being, **you are one with all that is**.”
- “**Love as a continuous state is as yet very rare – as rare as conscious human beings.** Brief and elusive glimpses of love, however, are possible whenever there is a gap in the stream of mind.”
- “**Love isn’t a portal; it’s what comes _through_ the portal into this world.** As long as you are completely trapped in your form identity, there can be no love. Your task is not to search for love but to **find a portal through which love can enter**.”
- “**True love has no opposite.** If your ‘love’ has an opposite, then it is not love but a strong ego-need for a more complete and deeper sense of self, a need that the other person temporarily meets.”
- “**The greatest catalyst for change in a relationship is complete acceptance of your partner** as he or she is, without needing to judge or change them in any way.”
- “**Love is a state of Being.** Your love is not outside; it is deep within you. You can never lose it, and it cannot leave you.”
- “What is God? The eternal One Life underneath all the forms of life. **What is love? To feel the presence of that One Life deep within yourself and within all creatures. To be it.** Therefore, all love is the love of God.”
- “True communication is communion – the realization of oneness, **which is love**.”
- “**Love, joy, and peace are deep states of Being or rather three aspects of the state of inner connectedness with Being.** As such, they have no opposite. This is because they arise from beyond the mind. Emotions, on the other hand, being part of the dualistic mind, are subject to the law of opposites.”

### **Awakening & Enlightenment**

“The word enlightenment conjures up the idea of some superhuman accomplishment, and the ego likes to keep it that way, but **it is simply your natural state of _felt_ oneness with Being**. It is a **state of connectedness** with something immeasurable and indestructible, something that, almost paradoxically, is **essentially you and yet is much greater than you**. It is finding **your true nature** beyond name and form.”

**Awakening:**

- “Most people are in love with their particular life drama. Their story is their identity. The ego runs their life. They have their whole sense of self invested in it. Even their – usually unsuccessful – search for an answer, a solution, or for healing becomes part of it. What they fear and resist most is the end of their drama. **As long as they _are_ their mind, what they fear and resist most is their own awakening.**“
- “What we are doing here is part of a profound transformation that is taking place in the collective consciousness of the planet and beyond: **the awakening of consciousness from the dream of matter, form, and separation**. The ending of time. We are breaking mind patterns that have dominated human life for eons. Mind patterns that have created unimaginable suffering on a vast scale.”
- “Your primary task is not to seek salvation through creating a better world, but to **awaken out of identification with form**.”
- “**The single most vital step on your journey toward enlightenment is this: learn to disidentify from your mind.** Every time you create a gap in the stream of mind, the light of your consciousness grows stronger.”
- “You are leaving behind the deadening world of mental abstraction, of time. You are getting out of the insane mind that is draining you of life energy, just as it is slowly poisoning and destroying the Earth. **You are awakening out of the dream of time into the present.**“
- “**Watch out for any kind of defensiveness within yourself.** What are you defending? An illusory identity, an image in your mind, a fictitious entity.”
- “**Once you have disidentified from your mind, whether you are right or wrong makes no difference to your sense of self at all**, so the forcefully compulsive and deeply unconscious need to be right, which is a form of violence, will no longer be there … Your sense of self is then derived from a deeper and truer place within yourself, not from the mind.”
- “One day you may **catch yourself smiling at the voice in your head**, as you would smile at the antics of a child. **This means that you no longer take the content of your mind all that seriously, as your sense of self does not depend on it.**“
- “**The essence of what I am saying here cannot be understood by the mind.** The moment you grasp it, there is a shift in consciousness from mind to Being, from time to presence. Suddenly, everything feels alive, radiates energy, emanates Being.”

**Enlightenment:**

- “I love the Buddha’s simple definition of **enlightenment as ‘the end of suffering.’**“
- “If there isn’t an emanation of love and joy, complete presence and openness toward all beings, **then it is not enlightenment**.”
- “Enlightenment is a **state of wholeness**, of being **‘at one’** and therefore at peace. At one with life in its manifested aspect, the world, as well as with your deepest self and life unmanifested – at one with Being. Enlightenment is not only the end of suffering and of continuous conflict within and without, but also **the end of the dreadful enslavement to incessant thinking**. What an **incredible liberation** this is!”
- “Enlightenment means **rising above thought**, not falling back to a level below thought.”
- “In the enlightened state, you still use your thinking mind when needed, but in a **much more focused and effective** way than before.”
- “You use it (your mind) mostly for practical purposes, but you are **free of the involuntary internal dialogue**, and there is **inner stillness**. When you do use your mind, and particularly when a creative solution is needed, you oscillate every few minutes or so between thought and stillness, between mind and no-mind.”
- “**Everything is honored, but nothing matters.** Forms are born and die, yet you are aware of the eternal underneath the forms. You know that ‘nothing real can be threatened.'”
- “To **know yourself as the Being underneath the thinker**, the stillness underneath the mental noise, the love and joy underneath the pain, is freedom, salvation, enlightenment.”
- “Do you need to have a relationship with yourself at all? Why can’t you just _be_ yourself? When you have a relationship with yourself, you have split yourself into two: ‘I’ and ‘myself,’ subject and object. That mind-created duality is the root cause of all unnecessary complexity, of all problems and conflict in your life. **In the state of enlightenment, you _are_ yourself – ‘you’ and ‘yourself’ merge into one.** You do not judge yourself, you do not feel sorry for yourself, you are not proud of yourself, you do not love yourself, you do not hate yourself, and so on. **The split caused by self-reflective consciousness is healed, its curse removed.** There is no ‘self’ that you need to protect, defend, or feed anymore. **When you are enlightened, there is one relationship that you no longer have: the relationship with yourself.** Once you have given that up, all your other relationships will be love relationships.”

**Other terms for “enlightenment” are “liberation” and “salvation”:**

- “The good news is that you _can_ free yourself from your mind. **This is the only true liberation.**“
- “**The present moment holds the key to liberation.** But you cannot find the present moment as long as you _are_ your mind.”
- “**Salvation is not elsewhere in place or time. It is here and now.**“
- “True salvation is **fulfillment, peace, life in all its fullness.** It is to be who you are, to feel within you the good that has no opposite, the joy of Being that depends on nothing outside itself.”
- “True salvation is to **know yourself as an inseparable part of the timeless and formless One Life** from which all that exists derives its being.”
- “True salvation is a **state of freedom – from fear, from suffering, from a perceived state of lack and insufficiency** and therefore from all wanting, needing, grasping, and clinging. It is **freedom from compulsive thinking, from negativity, and above all from past and future as a psychological need**.”
- “Your mind is telling you that you cannot get there from here. Something needs to happen, or you need to become this or that before you can be free and fulfilled. It is saying, in fact, that you need time – that you need to find, sort out, do, achieve, acquire, become, or understand something before you can be free or complete. **You see time as the means to salvation, whereas in truth it is the greatest obstacle to salvation.**“
- “You think that you can’t get there from where and who you are at this moment because you are not yet complete or good enough, but the **truth is that here and now is the only point from where you _can_ get there. You ‘get’ there by realizing that you _are_ there already.**“
- “**There is nothing you can ever do or attain that will get you closer to salvation than it is at this moment.**“

# Chapter Summaries


---

**Chapter 1: You are not your mind**

- The beginning of freedom is the realization that you are not the possessing entity, the thinker. Knowing this enables you to observe the entity. The moment you start watching the thinker, a higher level of consciousness becomes activated. You then begin to realize that there is a vast realm of intelligence beyond thought, that thought is only a tiny aspect of that intelligence. You also realize that all the things that truly matter – beauty, love, creativity, joy, inner peace – arise from beyond the mind. You begin to awaken.
- So you see and judge the present through the eyes of the past and get a totally distorted view of it. It is not uncommon for the voice to be a person’s own worst enemy.
- Instead of “watching the thinker”, you can also create a gap in the mind stream simply by directing the focus of your attention into the now. Just become intensely conscious of the present moment. This is a deeply satisfying thing to do. In this way, you draw consciousness away from mind activity and create a gap of no-mind in which you are highly alert and aware but not thinking. This is the essence of meditation.
- Become aware of a silent but powerful sense of presence. There is one certain criterion by which you can measure your success in the practice: the degree of peace that you feel within.
- So the single most vital step on your journey toward enlightenment is this: learn to disidentify from your mind. Every time you create a gap in the stream of mind, the light of your consciousness grows stronger.
- To the ego, the present moment hardly exists. Only past and future are considered important.
- The present moment holds the key to liberation. But you cannot find the present moment as long as you are your mind.
- The predominance of mind is no more than a stage in the evolution of consciousness. We need to go on to the next stage now as a matter of urgency, otherwise, we will be destroyed by the mind, which has grown into a monster.
- The mind is essentially a survival machine.
- Pleasure is always derived from something outside you, whereas joy arises from within.

**Chapter 2: Consciousness: The way out of pain**

- The more you are able to honor and accept the now, the more you are free of pain, of suffering – and free of the egoic mind.
- “What time?” they would ask. “Well, of course, it’s now. The time is now. What else is there?”
- Realize deeply that the present moment is all you ever have. Make the now the primary focus of your life.
- Surrender to what is. Say “yes” to life – and see how life suddenly starts working for you rather than against you.
- Everything is shown up by being exposed to the light, and whatever is exposed to the light itself becomes light.
- The most common ego identifications have to do with possessions, the work you do, social status and recognition, knowledge and education, physical appearance, special abilities, relationships, personal and family history, belief systems, and other collective identifications. None of these is you.
- All of these things you will have to relinquish sooner or later.
- Death is a stripping away of all that is not you. The secret of life is to “die before you die” – and find that there is no death.

**Chapter 3: Moving deeply into the now**

- The present moment is all you ever have. There is never a time when your life is not “this moment”. Is this not a fact.
- The mind then creates an obsession with the future as an escape from the unsatisfactory present.
- Usually, the future is a replica of the past.
- The quality of your consciousness at this moment is what shapes the future.
- It is the quality of your consciousness at this moment that determines the future, then what is it that determines the quality of your consciousness? Your degree of presence. So the only place where true change can occur and where the past can be dissolved is the now.
- All negativity is caused by an accumulation of psychological time and denial of the present.
- You may find it hard to recognize that time is the cause of your suffering or your problems.
- What you refer to as your “life” should more accurately be called your “life situation”.
- Be aware of the silent presence of each thing.
- It’s about realizing that there are no problems. Only situations.
- A great deal of what people say, think, or do is actually motivated by fear, which of course is always linked with having your focus on the future and being out of touch with the now. As there are no problems in the now, there is no fear either.
- If there is no joy, ease, or lightness in what you are doing, it does not necessarily mean that you need to change what you are doing. It may be sufficient to change the how, “How” is always more important than “what”.
- So do not be concerned with the fruit of your action – give attention to the action itself. The fruit will come of its own accord.
- Nonattachment to the fruit of your action.
- When the compulsive striving away from the now ceases, the joy of being flows into everything you do. The moment your attention turns to the now, you feel a presence, a stillness, a peace. You no longer depend on the future for fulfilment and satisfaction – you don’t look to it for salvation. Therefore, you are not attached to the results. Neither failure nor success has the power to change your inner state of being. You have found the life underneath your life situation.

**Chapter 4: Mind Strategies for avoiding the now**

- The root of suffering is to be found in our constant wanting and craving.
- Humans are a dangerously insane and very sick species.
- Wherever you are, be there totally.
- If you find your here and now intolerable and it makes you unhappy, you have three options: remove yourself from the situation, change it, or accept it totally. If you want to take responsibility for your life, you must choose one of those three options, and you must choose now.
- Any action is often better than no action.
- Only a surrendered person has spiritual power .
- Waiting is a state of mind. Basically, it means that you want the future; you don’t want the present. You don’t want what you’ve got, and you want what you haven’t got.
- There is nothing wrong with striving to improve your life situation. You can improve your life situation, but you cannot improve your life. Life is primary. Life is your deepest inner being. It is already whole, complete, perfect. Your life situation consists of your circumstance and your experiences. There is nothing wrong with setting goals and striving to achieve things. The mistake lies in using it as a substitute for the feeling of life, for being.
- Outer riches and inner poverty, or to “gain the world and lose your soul,”. Ultimately, of course, every outer purpose is doomed to “fail” sooner or later, simply because it is subject to the law of impermanence of all things. The sooner you realize that your outer purpose cannot give you lasting fulfilment, the better
- Only the present can free you from the past.
- You cannot find yourself by going into the past. You find yourself by coming into the present.



**Chapter 5: The state of presence**

- The teacher and the taught together create the teaching. In any case, the words in themselves are not important. They are not the truth; they only point to it.
- I am that i am.
- The second coming of Christ is a transformation of human consciousness, a shift from time to presence, from thinking to pure consciousness.

**Chapter 6: The inner body**

- Life is like the light switch and the light globe. All people have their light globe on (living) and are scared of their light globe turning off (death) because they fear the dark (after death) none existence. But who turned on your light in the first place. Where were you before your globe turned on?
- The illusion that you are nothing more than your physical body and your mind. This “illusion of the self”.
- To become conscious of being, you need to reclaim consciousness from the mind. This is one of the most essential tasks on your spiritual journey. It will free vast amounts of consciousness that previously had been trapped in useless and compulsive thinking.
- Transformation is through the body, not away from it.
- Do not fight against the body, for in doing so you are fighting against your own reality. You are your body. The body that you can see and touch is only a thin illusory veil. Underneath it lies the invisible inner body, the doorway into being, into life unmanifested through the inner body; you are inseparably connected to this unmanifested one life – birthless, deathless, eternally present. Through the inner body, you are forever one with god.

**Chapter 7: Portals into the unmanifested**

- Feeling will get you closer to the truth of who you are than thinking.
- Your task is not to search for love but to find a portal through which love can enter.
- Every physical object or body has come out of nothing, is surrounded by nothing, and will eventually return to nothing. Not only that, but even inside every physical body there is far more “nothing” than something.
- Form is emptiness, emptiness is form.
- The essence of all things is emptiness.
- Space has no existence. To exist literally means to stand out. You cannot understand space because it doesn’t stand out.
- Nothing real can be threatened. Nothing unreal exists. Herein lies the peace of god.
- You also know that every form is destined to dissolve again and that ultimately nothing out here matter’s all that much. You have overcome the world, in the words of Jesus, or, as the Buddha put it, you have “crossed over to the other shore”.
- If there were no illusion, there would be no enlightenment.” It is through the world and ultimately through you that the unmanifested knows itself.
- We live in a culture that is almost totally ignorant of death, as it is almost totally ignorant of anything that truly matters.
- Every portal is a portal of death, the death of the false self. When you go through it, you cease to derive your identity from your psychological, mind-made form. You then realize that death is an illusion, just as your identification with form was an illusion. The end of illusion – that’s all that death is. It is painful only as long as you cling to illusion.

**Chapter 8: Enlightened Relationships**

- Most people pursue physical pleasures or various forms of psychological gratification because they believe that those things will make them happy or free them from a feeling of fear or lack.
- True salvation is a state of freedom – from fear, from suffering, from a perceived state of lack and insufficiency and therefore from all wanting, needing, grasping, and clinging. It is freedom from compulsive thinking, from negativity, and above all from past and future as a psychological need.
- What is god? The eternal one life underneath all the forms of life. What is love? To feel the presence of that one life deep within yourself and within all creatures. To be it. Therefore, all love is the love of god.
- True communication is communion.
- The realization of oneness, which is love. Usually, this is quickly lost again, unless you are able to stay present enough to keep out the mind and its old patterns. As soon as the mind and mind identification return, you are no longer yourself but a mental image of yourself, and you start playing games and roles again to get your ego needs met.
- Humanity is under great pressure to evolve because it is our only chance of survival as a race.
- To relinquish judgement does not mean that you do not recognize dysfunction and unconsciousness when you see it. It means “being the knowing” rather than “being the reaction” and the judge.

**Chapter 9: Beyond Happiness and unhappiness there is peace**

- Happiness depends on conditions being perceived as positive, inner peace does not.
- Through allowing the “isness” of all things, a deeper dimension underneath the play of opposites reveals itself to you as an abiding presence, an unchanging deep stillness, an uncaused joy beyond good and bad. This is the joy of being, the peace of god.
- All conditions are highly unstable and in constant flux, or, as he put it, impermanence is a characteristic of every condition, every situation you will ever encounter in your life. It will change, disappear, or no longer satisfy you.
- The most essential kind of knowledge is not yet widely accessible.
- Nothing can give you joy. Joy is uncaused and arises from within as the joy of being. It is an essential part of the inner state of peace, the state that has been called the peace of god. It is your natural state, not something that you need to work hard for or struggle to attain.
- All that arises passes away. This i know. What he meant, of course, was this: i have learned to offer no resistance to what is, i have learned to allow the present moment to be and to accept the impermanent nature of all things and conditions. Thus I have found peace.
- To offer no resistance to life is to be in state of grace, ease, and lightness.
- All those things, of course, will still pass away cycles will come and go, but with dependency gone there is no fear of loss anymore. Life flows with ease.
- Having gone beyond the mind-made opposites, you become like a deep lake. The outer situation of your life and whatever happens there is the surface of the lake. Sometimes calm, sometimes windy and rough, according to the cycles and seasons. Deep down, however, the lake is always undisturbed. You are the whole lake, not just the surface, and you are in touch with your own depth, which remains absolutely still. You don’t resist change by mentally clinging to any situation. Your inner peace does not depend on it. You abide in being – unchanging, timeless, deathless – and you are no longer dependent for fulfilment or happiness on the outer world of constantly fluctuating forms. You can enjoy them, play with them, create new forms, appreciate the beauty of it all. But there will be no need to attach yourself to any of it
- Awaken out of identification with form.
- Only those who have transcended the world can bring about a better world.

**Chapter 10: The meaning of surrender**

- Surrender is the simple but profound wisdom of yielding to rather than opposing the flow of life.
- You cannot be conscious and unhappy, conscious and in negativity. Negativity, unhappiness , or suffering in whatever form means that there is resistance, and resistance is always unconscious.
- If you cannot surrender, take action immediately. Speak up or do something to bring about a change is the situation – or remove yourself from it. Take responsibility for your life. Do not pollute your beautiful, radiant inner being nor the earth with negativity. Do not give unhappiness in any form whatsoever a dwelling place inside you.
- You only need to be concerned with the inner aspect. That is primary. Of course, that will also transform the conduct of your outer life, your relationships and so on.
- You attract and manifest whatever corresponds to your inner state.
- God is being itself, not a being. There can be no subject-object relationship here, no duality, no you and god.
- The mind always adheres to the known.
- The unknown is dangerous because it has no control over it. That’s why the mind dislikes and ignores the present moment. Present-moment awareness creates a gap not only in the stream of mind but also in the past-future continuum. Nothing truly new and creative can come into this world except through that gap, that clear space of infinite possibility.
- It always looks as if people had a choice, but that is an illusion. As long as your mind with it’s a conditioned patterns runs your life, as long as you are your mind, what choice do you have? None. You are not even there. The mind-identified state is severely dysfunctional. It is a form of insanity. Almost everyone is suffering from this illness in varying degrees. The moment you realize this, there can be no resentment. How can you resent someone’s illness? The only appropriate response is compassion.
- When you surrender to what is and so become fully present, the past ceases to have any power. You do not need it anymore. Presence is the key. The now is the key.
- Greatest guru of all: life.
