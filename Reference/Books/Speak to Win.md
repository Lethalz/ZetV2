# Speak to Win


### **Art of Speaking**

Advice: Slow down, pause, and smile between points and sentences

Start with end in mind = objective question ‘What do you want your listeners to remember and do after your presentation?’

Short talk (1-30 mins)

1. Opening: Tell them what you’re going to say
2. Body: Tell them. 3 key points in logical sequence
3. Summary: Repeat the 3 key points

Longer talk

1. Opening: Get attention, build expectations
2. Introduction: Tell them what’s coming, why it’s important
3. 1st key point
4. Transition into 2nd key point. Make the separation clear.
5. 2nd key point. Must flow logically from 1st
6. Another transition. 2nd to 3rd
7. 3rd key point. Reaching the end.
8. Summary: Conclusion, Call to action

Learn to recite poetry aloud. Memorise it and use it as warm-up.

People will forget what you said, but they’ll remember how you said it.

Listen to other speakers and learn from them. Grade them 1-10.

### **Planning and preparation made simple**

90% of your success as a speaker depends on your planning.

Be overprepared to retain credibility.

Know your audience:

1. Age and age range
2. Gender mix
3. Income
4. Education
5. Occupation
6. Family status
7. Audience familiarity with your subject
8. How do they think
9. Common desires
10. Customise it for them

Be clear about amount of time you are given and stick to it.

Know the structure such as QnA.

How to prepare:

1. Clean sheet of paper
2. Write title at the top
3. 1-sentence description or objective of talk/book
4. Down dump every idea, data, phrase, example
5. Select and put in a logical structure
6. Use Red pen to choose most impactful points

PREP formula for writing:

1. P = Point of View. State your idea/fact at beginning
2. R = Reasons for holding this view
3. E = Example to illustrate, reinforce , prove your view
4. P = Point of view restated for emphasis

Organise every key point using PREP.

Windshield-Wiper Method: Right brain (feelings, stories, quote), Left brain (facts and info) keep audience engaged.To prepare, have a piece of table with two columns. Write fact on left and corresponding story/quote on the right.

1. State a fact
2. Follow it up with story/quote/example
3. Repeat step 1 and 2.

Circles Method:

1. Draw circles for each main section
2. Data dump content into each circle

Openings and closings must be worded exactly. Practise this in front of mirror.

Visual tips

Magic Wand technique: Wave a pen like a wand

1. Ask ‘Imagine you could wave a magic wand over this situation and make it perfect, what would it look like?’
2. Wave pen, Pause for them to think
3. Discuss strategies to help them

PowerPoint:

1. 5×5 rule: Max 5 lines per slide and max 5 words per line
2. Bring point up one by one, don’t show all
3. Face the audience. Put laptop in front of you. As you click, look at them all the time.
4. Press ‘B’ when not using.
5. Make sure room has enough lights for them to see your face
6. Practise 3-5x dry runs
7. Keep attention on you and your message

Smooth delivery

3 talks: The one you planned to speak, the one you spoke and the one you wished you’d spoken. Hopefully they are all the same!

Design your transitions from point to point very clearly.

Use memory technique, mnemonics.

Design your talk with a word. E.g. SUCCESS acronym

Put key point on index cards with large letters. Shuffle them.

Speak in small groups first before larger groups.

Walk and talk to practise.

Google some ‘inside’ info on key people and quotes. E.g. motto, quotes

– Visualise (see yourself speaking well)

– Internal and external visualisation (see yourself well in 1st and 3rd POV)

– Program mind (before sleep, visualise success)

– Emotionalise (end of movie thinking, you know good ending so relax you)

– Actualise (Subconscious don’t know what is real)

5. Last minute prep

– Check out room and equipment

– Control breathing (7x7x7 secs)

– Wiggle toes, roll shoulder

It clashes a bit with my own idea, but I would like to understand it better.’’ or ‘‘That is an interesting point. How would you answer the question that another person might ask if he or she were to challenge this point by saying such and such a thing?’’
