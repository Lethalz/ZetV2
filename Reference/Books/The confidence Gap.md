# The confidence Gap

**Rule 1: The actions of confidence comes first. The feelings of confidence comes later**.

-   The Confidence Gap – _“I can’t achieve it until I gain more confidence”_ self limiting belief

-   **Confidence**: feeling of certainty or act of trust
-   **Mindfulness**: empty state of awareness ; came from eastern philosophy first
-   **Defusion**: separate yourself from defeating thoughts
-   **Expansion**: ability to open up to emotions
-   **Engagement**: be psychologically present

-   **Reasons We Lack Confidence:**
-   1) Excessive expectations and perfectionism
-   2) Harsh self judgment such as imposter syndrome
-   3) Preoccupation with fear
-   4) Lack of experience
-   5) Lack of skill

-   **How to Get Skills For Confidence:**
-   1) Practice the skill
-   2) Apply them effectively
-   3) Assess the results
-   4) Modify as needed

**Rule 2: Genuine confidence is not the absence of fear. It is a transformed relationship with fear**.

-   **Myths About Fear:**
-   Myth 1: Fear is a sign of weakness
-   Myth 2: Fear impairs performance
-   Myth 3: Fear holds you back
-   Myth 4: Confidence is the absence of fear

**Rule 3: Negative thoughts are normal. Don’t fight them. Defuse them**.

-   **Defusion**: separation of thoughts
-   **Thoughts**: words and pictures inside our head
-   Your mind always has something to say or show and has the tendency to be negative
-   But are negative thoughts really a problem?
-   Thoughts do not control action. They merely influence it.
-   It doesn’t matter if your thoughts are true or false. It matters if your thoughts are helpful or not.

-   Most important word: **Workability**
-   Is what you’re doing working to help create a more meaningful, richer, and fuller life?

-   **How We Should Respond to Reason Giving in Our Minds:**
-   1) Obstacles – _“I don’t have enough time so I’ll cut down TV”_
-   2) Self judgments – _“I’m not good at jokes so I’ll buy a joke book”_
-   3) Comparisons – _“How can emulate Tiger Woods?”_
-   4) Predictions – _“There’s no guarantee of success but I gave it my best”_

-   **Exercise 1:** _**“I’m having the thought that**…”_
-   Bring to mind something that hooks you in the _“I can’t do it story”_ and acknowledge it
-   **Exercise 2: Use the same judgment**
-   Replay the same self judgment and sing it to the tune of happy bday
-   **Exercise 3: Silly words and same judgment**
-   Hear the same self judgment in the words of a cartoon character, sitcoms , sports commenter, Shakespearean actor
-   **Exercise 4: Computer Screen**
-   Imagine on the self judgment on a screen and play around with the fonts, color, format
-   **Exercise 5: Pretend your hands are your thoughts**
-   Place the self judgment in front of you with arms side by side to your face and bring it closer to you
-   **Other exercises:**
-   Thank the mind by saying _“thanks, mind”_ or _“good story”_
-   Silently say _“I got hooked”_ and try the exercises
-   Have a sense of humor by saying _“ah, there’s the self doubt radio again”_

-   **3 Steps to Defusion:**
-   1) Notice it
-   2) Name it with humor and metaphor – _“There goes the fascist dictator” or “there goes doom and gloom”_
-   3) Neutralize it by imaging it as a pop up
-   The P Word – Practice

-   **Leaves on The Stream Exercise (5-15 mins):**
-   1) Find a comfortable position sitting or lying , closing eyes
-   2) Imagine a gentle flowing stream

-   4) Place every word on top of the leaf whether picture or word. Let it float on by
-   5) If you find it hard, imagine an expansive black space with a breeze. Let thoughts flow into blackness
-   6) Do this for each and every thought whether happy or sad
-   7) Don’t get rid of it. Just let it pass
-   8) If thoughts stop, just watch
-   9) If it is too hard, take note of that on a leaf too
-   10) Restart if failed
-   11) Let stuck leaves stay
-   12) Acknowledge the uncomfortable feelings
-   13) Acknowledge you got hooked

**Rule 4: Self acceptance trumps self esteem**.

-   **High self esteem:** evaluating oneself positively
-   High self esteem correlates with narcissism and egotism
-   Self acceptance and self awareness are more important
-   People with low self esteem feel worse after receiving positive affirmations
-   We need to be engaged and present and pay more attention to what’s in front of us

-   _Exercise_: conjure up an image of someone you love, someone at work and someone for play to read their mind to see what kind of person you are

**Rule 7: Stop obsessing over the outcome and fall in love with the process**.

**Rule 8: Don’t fight your fear. Allow it, befriend it and channel it**.

-   **Fear**: feeling of apprehension in response to real or imagined threat
-   **Autopilot mode**: emotions control us and we live passively
-   Types of distractions – books, movies, sports, games, cleaning, sex, work, partying, etc…
-   But the more we avoid fear, the bigger the fear comes
-   **Exposure**: staying in contact with whatever you’re afraid of
	- Graded exposure : step-by-step exposure
- If we spend our life avoiding a feeling you will never get over it

-   **Steps to Acknowledge Fear:** **N.A.M.E**
-   Step 1: Notice it in your body and zoom in on it
-   Step 2: Acknowledge – say _“here’s fear”_ rather than _“I’m afraid_.” Remind yourself it is a normal feeling and you are not your feelings
-   Step 3: **Make space for it** and breathe deeply
-   Step 4: Expand awareness

-   **5 Pitfalls of Defusion:**
-   1) Hidden agenda – trying to remove fear won’t work
-   2) Illusion of control – don’t expect fear will disappear
-   3) Getting hooked – refer back to defusion method
-   4) Tolerance – be accepting of fear, not tolerating
-   5) Forgetting the point is to make room for fear

**Rule 9: Failure hurts, but if we’re willing to learn, then it’s a wonderful teacher**.

-   Motivation is the desire to do something, and it is impossible not to have it
-   differentiate motivation VS commitment
-   _Even though I don’t feel motivated, am I willing to take action ?_
- Stop focusing on the end result or your thoughts and feelings and engage fully in the task you are doing.

-   **How to Change Relationship With Failure:**
-   1) Regularly reminding self that **failure is fact of life**
    -   Ex: collect stories of Walt Disney, Oprah Winfrey, Albert Einstein, Steven Steinburg, Microsoft Bill Gates, Abraham Lincoln
-   2) Collect favorite quotes
-   3) Play by the rule of 6 values

-   **How to Rebound From Failure**
-   Step 1: Unhook – notice, name the feeling by saying _“I’m having the thought that I failed”_
-   Step 2: Make space for it by observing painful sensations and touch it
-   Step 3: Be kind to yourself by imagining someone else is feeling what you’re feeling and offer comfort
-   Step 4: Appreciate what worked
-   Step 5: Find something useful by asking _“How can I learn or grow from this?_“
-   Step 6: Take a stand by asking the following:
    
    -   _“What do I want to stand for?”_
    -   _“What values do I want to bring in play?”_
    
    -   _“What values should I bring so that ten years from now I can look back in pride for how I responded?”_

**Rule 10: The key to peak performance is total engagement in the task**.

-   **Ways to Develop Self Awareness:**
-   1) Mindfulness
    -   Be aware of our thoughts and habits
-   2)Reflection
    -   _What did I do that worked?_
    -   _What did I do that didn’t work?_
    -   _What can I do next time?_
-   3) Feedback
    -   Find trustworthy mentors.

-   Don’t try to excel at everything or else you will face mediocrity or burnout
-   Flow states arise from when 
- a) we’re good at it 
- b) we’re engaged with it
-   
- Ask yourself: _“In this area of life, am I happy with being competent or do I need to excel?”_
