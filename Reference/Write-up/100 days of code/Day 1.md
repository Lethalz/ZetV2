```python
print("Welcome to the band name generator.")
city = input("What is the name of the city you grew up in?\n")
pet = input("Whats your pets name?\n")
print("Your garbage band is named", city + " " + pet,"!")

```


What we Learned:

Variables
String Concantatiation
Input
Print

-   Python is a programming language that can be used for a variety of tasks.
-   Variables are containers for storing data in Python. They can be assigned values, which can be changed later in the program.
-   String concatenation is the process of joining two or more strings together into a single string. In Python, this can be done using the `+` operator.
-   The `input()` function is used to get input from the user. It prompts the user to enter a value, which is then stored in a variable.
-   The `print()` function is used to display output on the screen. It can be used to display text, variables, and expressions.
-   In today's program, we used all of these concepts to create a band name generator.
-   First, we used the `print()` function to display a welcome message on the screen.
-   Then, we used the `input()` function to prompt the user for two inputs: the name of the city they grew up in and the name of their pet.
-   We stored the inputs in variables called `city` and `pet`.
-   Next, we used string concatenation to join the values of the `city` and `pet` variables into a single string.
-   Finally, we used the `print()` function again to display the final output, which consisted of a message and the concatenated string.
