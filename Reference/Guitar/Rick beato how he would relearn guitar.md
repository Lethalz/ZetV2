# Rick beato how he would relearn notes


Learn the scales up and down the fretboard  different positions for each key

use alternate picking and hammerons to go through scales faster

learn how to slide between positions 


connecting arpeggios and scales are very important
use the scales (w/arpeggios) to create chords 

spread triads (playing the third at the next octave)
major and minor
solidifys scale knowledge and arpeggios 


He then talks about learning [[Intro to chord functions|chord functions]]
