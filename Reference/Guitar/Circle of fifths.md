# Circle of fifths


<img src = 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1100/format:webp/1*ihEohPybHu0ourZkFHba-Q.png'>

Order Of Sharps: F C G D A E B (Father Charles Goes Down And Ends Battle)(Fast Cars Go dangerously around every bend )
Order Of Flats: B E A D G C F (Big Ed Actin' Dirty Go Call Father) BEADGo Car Fast



Used in the circle to determine which sharp is in each scale
In the scale of G (1 sharp) you go down the order of sharps in get this.. order
G A B C D E *F#*
Holy fuck so..
D major scale has 2 sharps
D E *F#* G A B *C#*
[Holy mother of god](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Myt9ybv0IaU)

The last note is always the new *sharp* in the key!
Eureka

It only goes up to 7 flats/sharps because the first note always repeats

it works for flat as well (use order of flats)

F G A Bb C D E
Bb C D Eb F G A
Eb F G Ab Bb C D
Ab Bb C Db Eb F G

the middle note is always the new *flat* in the key!

The circle goes in *clockwise* order of 5th degrees

## C D E F G

G is the 5th so therefore next in the circle and so on..



It goes in 4ths when you go *counter-clockwise*

## C D E F

F is the 4th hence the first letter going counter-clockwise and so on..

# How to use

## Figure out major scales

Band says song is in D major

You can say It is the second degree after C so it has 
**2 sharps**
Using the Order Of Sharps: (F C)G D A E B

The first two Letters are the only sharp notes: D E F# G A B C#

## Close Key SIgnatures

The closer the Major notes on the circle the more notes they have in common

Ypu borrow chords from close key signatures

## Relative Minor

Relative minors have the exact same notes started in a different spot

C D E F G A B 
A B C D E F G

You can move three spaces in the circle to find your relative minor
If i start at C..
C G D A
A is my relative minor
or on the guitar think of penatonic position 1

## Diatonic Chords

Family of chords connected to a specific key

Example : C
Chords next to it
Fmaj Cmaj Gmaj
The minors are in side right under the relative key signatures 
Dm Am Em then one furthest to the right and one off is the 'diminished chord'
So the diatonic chords are:
C Dm Em F G Am Bdiminished

# Dominant
5 degree

in C
C D E F G
G is dominant

Causes Tension 

Dom to the right   FC(G)
# subdominant

4th degree

leads to dominant

Sub to the left   (F)CG



Its a Bigger distance to go up to a G then down to a G
not the same interval
When your moving clockwise its 5ths ascending and 4ths desending (think of on a keyboard)
When your moving counter-clockwise its 5ths desending and 4ths ascending

Gotta Look into Transposing

Chords in a key using the circle

Diminished is one-half step below the 1 chord (int this case 'C')

Pull chords from parrallel minor
