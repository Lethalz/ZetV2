This may involve setting up a meeting with two teammates that are struggling to agree upon the best way to handle a shared task.  **Understanding motivations:** Getting to know your teammates and figuring out what pushes them to their best work is an effective skill to have.

## Project Management Methodologies

A project management methodology is a set of principles and practices that guide you in organizing your projects to ensure their optimum performance.

#### Waterfall
The Waterfall methodology — also known as the Waterfall model — is a sequential development process that flows like a waterfall through all phases of a project (analysis, design, development, and testing, for example), with each phase completely wrapping up before the next phase begins

- Linear , concrete 
- When a customer has clear vision or plan for what they want
- Building a house 

**Try this project management methodology if:**

-   The end goal of your project is clearly defined — and isn’t going to change.
    
-   The stakeholders know exactly what they want (and it isn’t going to change).
    
-   Your project is consistent and predictable (i.e. isn’t going to change).
    
-   You’re working in a regulated industry that needs extensive project tracking or documentation.
    
-   You might need to bring new people into the project midway through and get them up to speed quickly.
    

**This project management methodology might not be for you if:**

-   Your project is liable to change.
    
-   You don’t have a full picture of all the requirements before you start.
    
-   You need to do continuous testing or adapt to feedback during the process.
#### Agile
**Agile** involves short phases of collaborative, iterative work with frequent testing and regularly-implemented improvements. Some phases and tasks happen at the same time as others. In Agile projects, teams share responsibility for managing their own work. Scrum and Kanban are examples of Agile frameworks, which are specific development approaches based on the Agile philosophy.
- Iterative
- When they arent sure about the end result but have an idea of wha they want
- Pilot for a tv show or a website 

**Try this project management methodology if:**

-   Your project is liable to change.
    
-   You’re not sure at the outset what the solution will look like.
    
-   You need to work quickly, and it’s more important that you see speedy progress than perfect results.
    
-   Your stakeholders or client needs (or wants) to be involved at every stage.
    

**This project management methodology isn’t for you if:**

-   You need a lot of documentation (for example, if you’ll be bringing new people on-board during the project).
    
-   You need a predictable deliverable, and you need to be crystal clear about what that looks like from the outset.
    
-   Your project can’t afford to change during its course.
    
-   You don’t have self-motivated people.
    
-   You have strict deadlines or deliverables that you need to stay on top of.
#### Lean Six Sigma
Lean project management is **an Agile methodology that increases customer value by eliminating waste from each project phase**.
There are five phases, Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control.
Improves the current process. and best practices
eight types of waste within an operation: defects, excess processing, overproduction, waiting, inventory, transportation, motion, and non-utilized talent.

- Define project goal and expectations for the process
	- Tells you what to measure
- Measure company data 
	- Tells you what to analyze
- Analyze gaps and issues
	- Tells you what to improve
- Improve present findings and make improvements
	- Tells you what to control
- Control Learning from the process and documenting

#### Six Sigma 

**Six Sigma** is a methodology used to reduce variations by ensuring that quality processes are followed every time. The term “Six Sigma” originates from statistics and generally means that items or processes should have 99.9996% quality.

The seven key principles of Six Sigma are:

1.  Always focus on the customer.
    
2.  Identify and understand how the work gets done. Understand how work really happens.
    
3.  Make your processes flow smoothly.
    
4.  Reduce waste and concentrate on value.
    
5.  Stop defects by removing variation.
    
6.  Involve and collaborate with your team.
    
7.  Approach improvement activity in a systematic way.




#### Others

##### Scrum 
**Scrum** is an Agile framework that focuses on developing, delivering, and sustaining complex projects and products through collaboration, accountability, and an iterative process. Work is completed by small, cross-functional teams led by a Scrum Master and is divided into short Sprints with a set list of deliverables.
	**Try this project management methodology if:**

-   You’re striving for continuous improvement.
    

**This project management methodology might not be for you if:**

-   You don’t have the full commitment from the team needed to make it work.


##### Kanban
**Kanban** is a tool used in both Agile and Lean approaches that provides visual feedback about the status of the work in progress through the use of Kanban boards or charts. With Kanban, project managers use sticky notes or note cards on a physical or digital Kanban board to represent the team’s tasks with categories like “To do,” “In progress,” and “Done.”

 **Try this project management methodology if:**

-   You’re looking for a visual representation of your project’s progress.
    
-   You want at-a-glance status updates.
    
-   You want to encourage using WIP limits so your team can stay focused.
    
-   You prefer to work on a continuous “pull” basis.
    

**This project management methodology might not be for you if:**

-   Your process is super complex or has tons of stages.
    
-   You want a push system instead of a pull system.

## Organizational structure and culture

### Organizational structure 
The way a comapany or organization is arranged
who reports to who

#### Classic

Function or top-down structure

![Classic Example](https://i.gyazo.com/1c3f982a1dd0a6cbfc3043ec423ad46c.png)



#### Matrix

Direct Higher-ups and stakeholders from other departments or programs

![Matrix axample](https://i.gyazo.com/6b9c8efd28fb61497464d44241ad1a1d.png)

#### Key takeaway 
In both Classic and Matrix organizations, project managers must clearly define roles and responsibilities in order to work effectively. However, within most Matrix organizations, some project managers or department leads may have the same level of authority as the functional managers and operate more directly.


####

How this impacts PM

#### Authority
- Who to escalate to
- who to report to
- who to updatae

#### Resource Availability
- Knowing how to access the people
- access equipment 
- access budget

#### Classic
Less authority
more escalation 
tradition top down

#### Matrix
More authority
share resources
not cleary define
learn stakeholders and above managers
more autonomy

### Organizational culture

The values emplyees share, as well as the organization's values, mission, and history.

#### **The importance of organizational culture**

**Identity:** An organization’s culture defines its identity. Its identity essentially describes the way the company conducts  business, both internally and externally.

**People:** Strong, positive organizational culture helps retain a company’s best employees. People who feel valued, engaged, and challenged are more likely to give their best and want to drive for success.

**Processes:** Organizational culture can have direct impacts on a company's processes, and ultimately, its productivity.

#### **Understanding an organization’s culture**

##### **Atmosphere**

-   What is the company’s dress code? 
    
-   How do people typically share credit at this company? 
    
-   Is risk-taking encouraged, and what happens when people fail?
    
-   How do managers support and motivate their team?
    
-   How do people in this role interact with customers and users?
    
-   When and how do team members give feedback to one another?
    
-   What are some workplace traditions?
    
-   What are some of the ways the company celebrates success?
    

##### **Policies**

-   What are the policies around sick days and vacation?
    
-   Does the company allow for employee flexibility (e.g., working from home, flexible working hours)?
    
-   What policies are in place that support employees sharing their identity in the workplace?
    

##### **Processes**

-   What is the company’s onboarding process?
    
-   How do employees measure the impact of their work?
    

##### **Values**

-   What are the company’s mission and value statements?
    
-   How might the person in this role contribute to the organization’s mission?

#### **Key takeaway**

Organizational culture is important because it has a direct impact on you as a project manager, and learning how to navigate organizational culture gives you a great advantage when you are executing projects. Being able to navigate departmental interactions, communicate effectively, and plan your project in line with the organization’s culture will help set you up for success in your project management career path.

## Change Management
The process of delievering your compoelted project and getting people to adopt it

When you are thinking about change management as it relates to your project, begin by asking yourself the following questions:

-   How will the organization react to change?
    
-   Which influencers can affect change?
    
-   What are the best means of communication? 
    
-   What change management practices will lead to the successful implementation of my project?

### Best practices

- **Be proactive** - Proactive and inclusive change management planning can help keep any potentially impacted stakeholders aware of the upcoming changes.
	-    **Incorporate change management into your project management steps.** For example, like when we spoke with QCD About the phone system situation
	- You can also plan steps towards the end of your project to introduce the deliverable to stakeholders in the form of demonstrations, question and answer forums, or marketing videos.

- **Communicate about upcoming changes** - Communication should occur regularly among impacted stakeholders, the change management team, and the project team.
	- you support the process by providing everyone with the information they need to feel prepared to adjust to changes once the project is ready to launch.

- **Follow a consistent process** - Following a clear change management process helps maintain consistency each time there is a change.

- **Practice empathy** - Changes are inevitable, but we are often resistant to them. By being empathetic to the challenges and anxiety change can bring, you can support the process in subtle ways.

- **Use tools.* - Incorporating tools to assist in the adoption of a change can be very helpful.
