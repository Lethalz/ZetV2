### **Teaching and mentoring**
serve as a mentor to your team. When you take the time to fully explain the expectations, you eliminate rework, confusion, and frustration.


### **Building relationships**

Getting to know your team members lets them know that you care about them as people, not just as employees. Taking the time to build relationships with your customers, clients, vendors, and other stakeholders is equally important.

### **Controlling change**
The American novelist Louis L’Amour wrote, “The only thing that never changes is that everything changes.”

Documenting the initial expectations of the project and clearly identifying the changes being requested. 
It is also helpful to understand the budget and schedule impact of the changes and make sure that the stakeholders understand those impacts.

### **Empowering your team**

Giving your team the ability to work directly with the stakeholders and their teams lets them know that you trust and believe in their skills!

### **Communicating status and concerns**
The project manager sets the tone for the project. Maintaining an open door policy and building trust within your team and among stakeholders—all while staying positive—will help the success of the project.

## Role Of Project Manager

1. Hold all team members accountable for their assigned tasks
2. ensure that issues and risks are tracked and visible, and be able to stablish excalation paths
3. help teammates adopt the right workflows and project management styles
4. collaborate with other teams at the organization to meet the requirements based on project scope, schedule, and budget.

As a project manager, you will likely work with **cross-functional teams**. 
A c**ross-functional team** includes team members who have different backgrounds, types of expertise, and job functions.

1. Clarify goals 
	Make sure the team understands their role and how that supports the team as a whole.
2. Get teammates with the right skills
3. measure progress
	Show the team how much they've accomplished
4. Recognize efforts
		make sure everyone feels valued not forgotten and be mindful of everyone.

## Core Skills of a Project Manager
Some core skils are **enabling decision-making**, **communicating and escalating**, **strong organizational skills**, and **flexibility**.
		you can help your team deal with **ambiguity**.
### **Enabling decision-making.**

Make the decision-making process collaborative.
	For example, state the goals of specific deliverables and elicit input from your team on how to achieve those goals.
team members may have more creative or efficient approaches than you would've created yourself.

### **Communicating and escalating**

Clearly communicate Goals and expectations.
Knowing when to escalate issures to management and how
	Approch managment with the problem but also the solutions
	Take Initiative

### **Strong organizational skills**

Stay organized
Utilize Organizational tools:

-   Planning and scheduling software (templates, workflows, calendars)
    
-   Collaboration tools (email, collaboration software, dashboards)
    
-   Documentation (files, plans, spreadsheets)
    
-   Quality assurance tools (evaluations, productivity trackers, reports)


### **Flexibility**

**Change is inevitable,** and the more flexible you are as a project manager, the more successful you will be throughout your career.

**Assess external constraints**
		Holidays, vacations, etc..


**Plan for risks and challenges**
		Review your past projects and examine the challenges you faced

**Calculate “float” in your schedule**.
		Float, or slack, refers to the amount of time you can wait to begin a task before it impacts the project schedule and threatens the project outcome.


### **Handling ambiguity**

- Keep calm
- Empathy
- Communicate what you know clearly
- Make secisions and stick to them
- Trust the expertise of your team







## Interpersonal skills as a PM
### **Interpersonal skills:**

**Enabling decision making:** The ability to enable decision making on the team, or gather decisions from the appropriate leader is crucial to keep projects on task and achieve their goals. As a project manager, you will need to enable decisions frequently.

**Communicating and escalating:** As a project manager, you’ll use your communication skills in just about everything you do. And you need to know when it is appropriate to escalate, so that critical issues are raised and addressed as soon as possible to reduce negative impact on a project.

**Remaining flexible:** As a project manager, knowing how to be flexible when changes are needed is key. Plans will change — even with careful, upfront planning. As a project manager being flexible is critical to be able to course correct and adapt when the unexpected happens.

**Organizational Skills:** Having strong organizational skills means having the ability to organize the core elements of a project and ensure nothing gets lost or overlooked. A project manager needs to be organized so that they can manage a project and all of its moving parts.

**Negotiation:** As a project manager, you’ll have to know how to balance the needs of your teammates with the needs of the project. For example, if a teammate says they can’t complete their work on time, you may need to compromise on a deadline. 

**Conflict mediation:** Resolving tension and conflict within a team is an important skill. This may involve setting up a meeting with two teammates that are struggling to agree upon the best way to handle a shared task.  **Understanding motivations:** Getting to know your teammates and figuring out what pushes them to their best work is an effective skill to have. Understanding motivations also involves understanding how your teammates prefer to receive feedback.

## Project Management Methodologies

A project management methodology is a set of principles and practices that guide you in organizing your projects to ensure their optimum performance.

#### Waterfall
The Waterfall methodology — also known as the Waterfall model — is a sequential development process that flows like a waterfall through all phases of a project (analysis, design, development, and testing, for example), with each phase completely wrapping up before the next phase begins

- Linear , concrete 
- When a customer has clear vision or plan for what they want
- Building a house 

**Try this project management methodology if:**

-   The end goal of your project is clearly defined — and isn’t going to change.
    
-   The stakeholders know exactly what they want (and it isn’t going to change).
    
-   Your project is consistent and predictable (i.e. isn’t going to change).
    
-   You’re working in a regulated industry that needs extensive project tracking or documentation.
    
-   You might need to bring new people into the project midway through and get them up to speed quickly.
    

**This project management methodology might not be for you if:**

-   Your project is liable to change.
    
-   You don’t have a full picture of all the requirements before you start.
    
-   You need to do continuous testing or adapt to feedback during the process.
#### Agile
**Agile** involves short phases of collaborative, iterative work with frequent testing and regularly-implemented improvements. Some phases and tasks happen at the same time as others. In Agile projects, teams share responsibility for managing their own work. Scrum and Kanban are examples of Agile frameworks, which are specific development approaches based on the Agile philosophy.
- Iterative
- When they arent sure about the end result but have an idea of wha they want
- Pilot for a tv show or a website 

**Try this project management methodology if:**

-   Your project is liable to change.
    
-   You’re not sure at the outset what the solution will look like.
    
-   You need to work quickly, and it’s more important that you see speedy progress than perfect results.
    
-   Your stakeholders or client needs (or wants) to be involved at every stage.
    

**This project management methodology isn’t for you if:**

-   You need a lot of documentation (for example, if you’ll be bringing new people on-board during the project).
    
-   You need a predictable deliverable, and you need to be crystal clear about what that looks like from the outset.
    
-   Your project can’t afford to change during its course.
    
-   You don’t have self-motivated people.
    
-   You have strict deadlines or deliverables that you need to stay on top of.
#### Lean Six Sigma
Lean project management is **an Agile methodology that increases customer value by eliminating waste from each project phase**.
There are five phases, Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control.
Improves the current process. and best practices
eight types of waste within an operation: defects, excess processing, overproduction, waiting, inventory, transportation, motion, and non-utilized talent.

- Define project goal and expectations for the process
	- Tells you what to measure
- Measure company data 
	- Tells you what to analyze
- Analyze gaps and issues
	- Tells you what to improve
- Improve present findings and make improvements
	- Tells you what to control
- Control Learning from the process and documenting

#### Six Sigma 

**Six Sigma** is a methodology used to reduce variations by ensuring that quality processes are followed every time. The term “Six Sigma” originates from statistics and generally means that items or processes should have 99.9996% quality.

The seven key principles of Six Sigma are:

1.  Always focus on the customer.
    
2.  Identify and understand how the work gets done. Understand how work really happens.
    
3.  Make your processes flow smoothly.
    
4.  Reduce waste and concentrate on value.
    
5.  Stop defects by removing variation.
    
6.  Involve and collaborate with your team.
    
7.  Approach improvement activity in a systematic way.




#### Others

##### Scrum 
**Scrum** is an Agile framework that focuses on developing, delivering, and sustaining complex projects and products through collaboration, accountability, and an iterative process. Work is completed by small, cross-functional teams led by a Scrum Master and is divided into short Sprints with a set list of deliverables.
	**Try this project management methodology if:**

-   You’re striving for continuous improvement.
    

**This project management methodology might not be for you if:**

-   You don’t have the full commitment from the team needed to make it work.


##### Kanban
**Kanban** is a tool used in both Agile and Lean approaches that provides visual feedback about the status of the work in progress through the use of Kanban boards or charts. With Kanban, project managers use sticky notes or note cards on a physical or digital Kanban board to represent the team’s tasks with categories like “To do,” “In progress,” and “Done.”

 **Try this project management methodology if:**

-   You’re looking for a visual representation of your project’s progress.
    
-   You want at-a-glance status updates.
    
-   You want to encourage using WIP limits so your team can stay focused.
    
-   You prefer to work on a continuous “pull” basis.
    

**This project management methodology might not be for you if:**

-   Your process is super complex or has tons of stages.
    
-   You want a push system instead of a pull system.

## Organizational structure and culture

### Organizational structure 
The way a comapany or organization is arranged
who reports to who

#### Classic

Function or top-down structure

![Classic Example](https://i.gyazo.com/1c3f982a1dd0a6cbfc3043ec423ad46c.png)



#### Matrix

Direct Higher-ups and stakeholders from other departments or programs

![Matrix axample](https://i.gyazo.com/6b9c8efd28fb61497464d44241ad1a1d.png)

#### Key takeaway 
In both Classic and Matrix organizations, project managers must clearly define roles and responsibilities in order to work effectively. However, within most Matrix organizations, some project managers or department leads may have the same level of authority as the functional managers and operate more directly.


####

How this impacts PM

#### Authority
- Who to escalate to
- who to report to
- who to updatae

#### Resource Availability
- Knowing how to access the people
- access equipment 
- access budget

#### Classic
Less authority
more escalation 
tradition top down

#### Matrix
More authority
share resources
not cleary define
learn stakeholders and above managers
more autonomy










 v 
### Organizational culture

The values emplyees share, as well as the organization's values, mission, and history.

#### **The importance of organizational culture**

**Identity:** An organization’s culture defines its identity. Its identity essentially describes the way the company conducts  business, both internally and externally.

**People:** Strong, positive organizational culture helps retain a company’s best employees. People who feel valued, engaged, and challenged are more likely to give their best and want to drive for success.

**Processes:** Organizational culture can have direct impacts on a company's processes, and ultimately, its productivity.

#### **Understanding an organization’s culture**

##### **Atmosphere**

-   What is the company’s dress code? 
    
-   How do people typically share credit at this company? 
    
-   Is risk-taking encouraged, and what happens when people fail?
    
-   How do managers support and motivate their team?
    
-   How do people in this role interact with customers and users?
    
-   When and how do team members give feedback to one another?
    
-   What are some workplace traditions?
    
-   What are some of the ways the company celebrates success?
    

##### **Policies**

-   What are the policies around sick days and vacation?
    
-   Does the company allow for employee flexibility (e.g., working from home, flexible working hours)?
    
-   What policies are in place that support employees sharing their identity in the workplace?
    

##### **Processes**

-   What is the company’s onboarding process?
    
-   How do employees measure the impact of their work?
    

##### **Values**

-   What are the company’s mission and value statements?
    
-   How might the person in this role contribute to the organization’s mission?
    
-   How does the organization support professional development and career growth?




#### **Key takeaway**

Organizational culture is important because it has a direct impact on you as a project manager, and learning how to navigate organizational culture gives you a great advantage when you are executing projects. Being able to navigate departmental interactions, communicate effectively, and plan your project in line with the organization’s culture will help set you up for success in your project management career path.

## Change Management
The process of delievering your compoelted project and getting people to adopt it

When you are thinking about change management as it relates to your project, begin by asking yourself the following questions:

-   How will the organization react to change?
    
-   Which influencers can affect change?
    
-   What are the best means of communication? 
    
-   What change management practices will lead to the successful implementation of my project?

### Best practices

- **Be proactive** - Proactive and inclusive change management planning can help keep any potentially impacted stakeholders aware of the upcoming changes.
	-    **Incorporate change management into your project management steps.** For example, like when we spoke with QCD About the phone system situation
	- You can also plan steps towards the end of your project to introduce the deliverable to stakeholders in the form of demonstrations, question and answer forums, or marketing videos.

- **Communicate about upcoming changes** - Communication should occur regularly among impacted stakeholders, the change management team, and the project team.
	- you support the process by providing everyone with the information they need to feel prepared to adjust to changes once the project is ready to launch.

- **Follow a consistent process** - Following a clear change management process helps maintain consistency each time there is a change.

- **Practice empathy** - Changes are inevitable, but we are often resistant to them. By being empathetic to the challenges and anxiety change can bring, you can support the process in subtle ways.

- **Use tools.* - Incorporating tools to assist in the adoption of a change can be very helpful. 
	- Feedback mechanisms (surveys , meetings ,emails)

# Project Initiation: Starting a Successful Project

### Why Project Initiation

A well planned initiation sets your project up for success

Identify project goals 
Identify project resources
Determine the criteria for project success with stakeholders


what could go wrong
resources you need
time it might take

Cost benefit analysis

The process of adding up the expected value of a project - the benefits - and comparing them to the dollar costs

Benefits

- what value will this project create
- how much money could this save
- how much money will this bring in
- how much time will be saved
- How much time will this project save customers?

Costs

- How much time will people have to spend on this project
- What will be the one-time costs?
- Are there any ongoing/longterm costs?

### Key components of project initiation

- goals
- scope
- deliverables
- success criteria
- stakeholders
- resources

#### Goal

the goal is what you've been asked to do and what you're trying to achieve.
Goals are the first thing a project manager needs to consider during the initiation phase.



#### scope
This is the process to define the work that needs to happen to complete the project.
Project managers use scope as a boundary—what should or shouldn’t be included in the project.
#### deliverables
They're the products and services that you will create for your customer, client or project sponsor.
A deliverable is the tangible and intangible outcomes of a project
#### success criteria

Success criteria are the standards by 

which you measure how successful a project was in reaching its goals.

#### stakeholders

Stakeholders are people who have an interest in, or are affected by, the completion of a successful project

instrumental in determining the goals, 
understand the needs of stakeholders
objectives, deliverables and success criteria of the project,

#### resources

It's super important to think carefully about these pieces early on.

### ROI (Return on Investment)

(G-C) / C = ROI %
You expect that a project will bring in $25,000 USD in revenue per year. You estimate it will cost $12,000 up front. You also estimate costs of $200 per month for the first 12 months, which equals $2,400 per year

(25,000 - 14,400) ÷ 14,400 = 0.74 = 74%



## Define Project Goals, scope, and success criteria

## Identifying Goals
### Determining project goals and deliverables

#### Goals

Figure out what needs to be done
define goals and delivarables

Project goal - desired outcome of the project

Goals give you a roadmap to your destinations

Well defined goals are specific and measurable

Listen to your stakeholders
Also Assess stakeholder power and influence and how each fits into the project
Be clear on project goals

#### Deliverables

The products or services that are created for the customer, client, or project sponsor.

What gets produced from the project that is made for the stakeholders 

delieverables need to be well dfined 
big part of the big goal

### SMART goals

**Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant,** and **Time-bound (SMART)** goals are very helpful for ensuring project success.

-   **Specific:** The objective has no ambiguity for the project team to misinterpret. 
	If goal is not specific itll be hard to know how long it'll take to complete or know when it's finished
	- What do i want to accomplish
	- Why is this a goal
	- who is involved
	- Where should the goal be delivered
	- to what degree
	- What are the requirments and constraints


-   **Measurable:** Metrics help the project team determine when the objective is met.
    - by asking how much how many and if its done
    
-   **Attainable:** The project team agrees the objective is realistic.
	    - Can it be attained
	    - Cant be too extreme or too easy
	- Atomic goals  (specific measurable and attainable)
-   **Relevant:** The goal fits the organization’s strategic plan and supports the project charter.
    - Is it relevant to the business as a whole right now and in the long term picture
    
-   **Time-bound:** The project team documents a date to achieve the goal.



### OKR 
Objectives + key results

Combines a goal and a metric to determine a measurable outcome

Objectives define **what needs to be achieved and describe a desired outcome.** Key results **define how the project team knows whether or not they have met their objective.**
Key results should be ambitious

- Example
Objective: improve customer retention
Key Result: achieve a 90% customer satidfaction rating by the end of the first quarter

<img src = "https://i.gyazo.com/86d53bb6a339f0ea531331fc66bcd74b.png"> 
What?          |                 How?
Objectives are the larger more broad goal 
Key results are the more specific mesurable occurances from the project

Find your Why your passion for your OKRs


## Define and determine Scope 

An agreed upon understanding as to what is included or excluded from a project.

Talk to stakeholders to determine what is and isn't include in the project scope.

Defining scope before a project starts helps mitigate the risk of big changes later on.

<img src = "https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/mN749RQOSWie-PUUDhloDg_12b56746f80a4790b7b6857b5242e8f1_Scope-questions.jpg?expiry=1669075200000&hmac=rbUNw4iqJ2lwGjA3Jo8HHIrIFRvwOYwZu1XqHIutnj8">


- In-scope - stuff within the scope of the project
- Out-of-scope - not within the scope of the project
- Scope creep - Changes, growth and uncontrolled factors that affect a project's scope at any point after the project begins


#### Scope Creep

Here are some best practices for scope management and controlling scope creep:

-   **Define your project’s requirements.** Communicate with your stakeholders or customers to find out exactly what they want from the project and document those requirements during the initiation phase. 
    
-   **Set a clear project schedule.** Time and task management are essential for sticking to your project’s scope. Your schedule should outline all of your project’s requirements and the tasks that are necessary to achieve them.
    
-   **Determine what is out of scope.** Make sure your stakeholders, customers, and project team understand when proposed changes are out of scope. Come to a clear agreement about the potential impacts to the project and document your agreement. 
    
-   **Provide** **alternatives.** Suggest alternative solutions to your customer or stakeholder. You can also help them consider how their proposed changes might create additional risks. Perform a cost-benefit analysis, if necessary.
    
-   **Set up a change control process.** During the course of your project, some changes are inevitable. Determine the process for how each change will be defined, reviewed, and approved (or rejected) before you add it to your project plan. Make sure your project team is aware of this process.
    
-   **Learn how to say no.** Sometimes you will have to say no to proposed changes. Saying no to a key stakeholder or customer can be uncomfortable, but it can be necessary to protect your project’s scope and its overall quality. If you are asked to take on additional tasks, explain how they will interfere with the budget, timeline, and/or resources defined in your initial project requirements. 
    
-   **Collect** **costs for out-of-scope work.** If out-of-scope work is required, be sure to document all costs incurred. That includes costs for work indirectly impacted by the increased scope. Be sure to indicate what the charges are for.

You can only avoid scope creep if everyone involved in the project understands and agrees on responsibilities, boundaries, and timelines.

### Managing scope changes


time budget and scope are all linked

<img src = "https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/GOEdQk1-T6ehHUJNfo-n-A_0cfb775c91ec44c39b72066d3de29bf1_triple-constraint.png?expiry=1669075200000&hmac=QL0_IejrYiDOlTy7DZ04gFZlm53zrQdeFIY3A8ssPKU"> 


## Success

### **Launching vs. landing a project**

In project management, a project “launching” means you have delivered the final results of the project to the client or user. You can’t solely base project success on when the client accepts the project.

Your work on a project won’t be complete until you “land” it by thoroughly **measuring** the results.


Teams should be clear on what they are trying to accomplish, beyond just launching something to users.

### **Launch and forget**

A common mistake of many project teams is to “launch and forget” the results. This happens when a project manager delivers the project to the client and the client accepts the project delivery, but the project manager doesn’t assess if the project deliverables satisfy the customer or user.

Launching your project to the client can be a very big moment for you. You handed over the project to your client and now you can take a step back and breathe. But make sure you l**and your project,** as well. Look over your notes, talk with your team, meet with the client, and remember to **return to your intended deliverables and metrics to help you measure success.**

### Success Criteria

We can determine the success of a project by the **quality of the product**, the ability to **fulfill the needs of your customers**, and the need to **meet the expectations of your stakeholders.**

#### **Product quality**
To measure the success of a product, consider including these metrics on your checklist: 

-   Track if you implemented the product’s priority requirements
    
-   Track and assess the product’s number of technical issues or defects
    
-   Measure the percentage of features you delivered or released at the end of the project

### **What is important to the customers or stakeholders**

Metrics to consider include:

-   Evaluating user engagement with the product 
    
-   Measuring stakeholder and customer satisfaction via surveys
    
-   Tracking user adoption of the product by using sales data

### **Document, align, and communicate success**

 It is best practice to get the key stakeholders or the steering committee to review and approve your success criteria.
 Communicate everything



## StakeHolders

### Choosing the right people for the job

- Required roles for each tasks
- Team size
- Neccesary skills from each team member
- Availability 
- Motivation

Always keep in mind that a project manager does not just select dream teams, they create dream teams through collaboration under great leadership. This is the leadership that you will provide as a project manager.

###  Essential project roles

The project manager
they use team-building techniques, motivation, influencing, decision-making, and coaching skills, to keep their teams strong. 

Project managers integrate all project work by developing the project management plan, directing the work, documenting reports, controlling change, and monitoring quality.

 **Stakeholders**

Stakeholders are often divided into two groups: **primary stakeholders,** also known as key stakeholders, and **secondary stakeholders.** A primary stakeholder is directly affected by the outcome of the project, while a secondary stakeholder is indirectly affected by the outcome of the project.


 **Sponsor**
The **project sponsor** is another primary stakeholder. A sponsor initiates the project and is responsible for presenting a business case for its existence, signing the project charter, and releasing resources to the project manager.

A project charter is **a formal short document that states a project exists and provides project managers with written authority to begin work**.






  
### Stakeholder analysis

1. Make a list of all the stakeholders the project impacts
2. Determine the level of **interest** and influence for each stakeholder
3. assess stakeholders' ability to participate and then find way to involve them
* interest is how much a stakeholder is affected by project.
* more interest = more important to the project. = key stakeholders


<img src = "https://i.gyazo.com/611f2178060b4f8a3356af613b1193e1.png">

effective way to track who to communicate with and when.

Once you organize and assess your stakeholders, it is time to start making some decisions on whose buy-in is absolutely necessary for success.

Tips for gaining key stakeholder buy-in include: 

-   Clearly mapping the work of the project to the goals of the stakeholder.
    
-   Describing how the project aligns with the goals of the stakeholder's department or team.
    
-   Listening to feedback from the stakeholder and finding ways to incorporate their feedback into the project's charter where appropriate.


### Building out a RACI chart

A [[RACI chart]] can be an extremely effective way to define project roles, give direction to each team member and stakeholder, and ensure work gets done efficiently.
A.K.A
**Responsibility Assignment Matrix (RAM), RACI diagram, or RACI matrix**

**R**: Responsible: who gets the work done
	What department does the work fall under?
**A**: Accountable: who makes sure the work is done
	Who will delegate the task to be completed?
**C**: Consulted: who gives input or feedback on work
	Who will the task impact?
**I**: Informed: who needs to know the outcome
	Who cares about this task’s completion?

#### **When should you use a RACI chart?**

If you are wondering if you should use a RACI chart on your project, it is a good idea to evaluate the complexity of the effort. For example, if you have a very small project team with a small amount of stakeholders, clearly defined roles, and a short timeline, introducing a RACI chart could possibly slow down the project. However, larger projects, or even projects that involve a large number of stakeholders, could greatly benefit from a RACI chart. It is always a good idea to work through the creation of a RACI chart and evaluate the outcome. Even if you do not end up using the RACI chart, you will have a better understanding of the project, and your effort will contribute to your project management experience overall.



### Why projects fail: Initiation missteps

 **Unclear expectations**
-   What is the end goal? 
    
-   What are the expected deliverables and schedule? 
    
-   What is the budget? 
    
-   Who are the stakeholders?

**Unrealistic expectations**

Rememebr our Smart goals one of the prerequisites is "Attainable". Although setting and achieving ambitious goals is fine, don't go too crazy with your expectations and dont commit to firm dates you are not sure of.


 **Miscommunication**

Speaks for itself , communication is key if information is not commincated in a timely matter it can cause risks to the project.


 **Lack of resources**
 Self-explanatory

**Scope creep**

The scope provides an overarching framework of what is and is not included in the project’s work and deliverables.
Dont go out of it.







## Project resources

- Budget 
- People
- Materials

Figure out your resources b4 the project gets rolling

### Budget 

Common aspects of your project budget will include:

-   Team: the cost of the people performing the work
-   Services: any outside vendors helping your project
-   Materials: any tangible items purchased to complete the project
- it is important to make sure that the budget is aligned with the project scope and the stakeholders’ asks.

### **People**
People are a vital resource on your project; you cannot complete your project on your own! Find the best and right people to get the job done!

### **Materials**
Materials can be different on every project.
Materials can be intangible 
- email storage 
- subcriptions
- etc..



## Documentation

Documentation helps set the stage for the project.
- Reference point
- easily assesable for new team members
- Reviewable

#### Project charter
A **project charter** clearly defines the project and outlines the necessary details for the project to reach its goals. A well-documented project charter can be a project manager’s secret weapon to success. In this reading, we will go over the function, key elements, and significance of a project charter and learn how to create one.


-   introduction/project summary
    
-   goals/objectives 
    
-   business case/benefits and costs
    
-   project team
    
-   scope
    
-   success criteria
    
-   major requirements or key deliverables
    
-   budget
    
-   schedule/timeline or milestones
    
-   constraints and assumptions
    
-   risks
    
-   OKRs
    
-   approvals

#### Project proposal

Kicks off the initiaon phase by influencing and persuading the company to move forward with the project.

Usually comes before the charter, this is used to get key stakeholders to buy into the project.\

### Project Kickoff Meeting

Use [[#Building out a RACI chart|Raci]] Chart to know who should be in this meeting

What this meeting does :
- Establish a shared vision
- Align on scope
- Build team rapport
- Allows Questions and insights
- Sets expectations for project

Give a background on why this project is even happening
Explain the goals and scope
have everyone indroduce themselves then explain project roles
Indroduce those who will be collaborating closely

The purpose of a kick-off meeting is to ground everyone in a shared vision, ensure they understand the project’s goals and scope, and make sure that they are all on the same page about their roles and responsibilities on the project.

### Defining tasks and milestones

Project task 

Activity that need
to be accomlished in a set amount of time.

Milestones
a significant point in the project schedule, multiple project tasks done.

- Miles stones gives you a clear understanding of the amount of work your project will require
- Break the project down into smaller chuncks
- keep breaking things down if possible to manage workloads better
- Motivates your team 

#### How to set milestones

Steps

1.  Evaluate your project as a whole.   
-  Make a list of what your teams needs to do to achieve sucess
- Smaller items are tasks Bigger ones are milestones
2. Assign each milestone a deadline
- space milestones out to give teammates time to consider
- regular indications of progress

#### **Milestone-setting pitfalls**


-   **Don’t set too many milestones**. When there are too many milestones, their importance is downplayed. And, if milestones are too small or too specific, you may end up with too many, making the project look much bigger than it really is to your team and stakeholders.  
    
-   **Don’t mistake tasks for milestones**. Remember that milestones should represent moments in time, and in order to map out how you will get to those moments, you need to assign smaller tasks to each milestone.
    
-   **Don’t list your milestones and tasks separately.** Make sure that tasks and milestones can be visualized together in one place, such as a project plan. This will help ensure that you are hitting your deadlines and milestones.


#### Example

Day at the beach

Milestones
		**Get to the beach**                       Enjoy our time at beach                  **Get home safely**
Make sure family is available      Get sunscreen
		Get the right attire                Plan out a place to eat
Figure out Navigation                  have a carrying pouch for the family
Make sure car is in order
Look for any weather advisorsy


You get the jist

### Work Breakdown Structure
