# Epiphanies on Money


1.  Don't focus on input, as much as focusing on the output.
	- The more money you make is the more money you'll spend unless you change your lifestyle.
	- It'll never be enough until it is, so focus on how much you're spending, not how much you are making.

2. Liability vs Assets
	-  Everything that doesn't make you money when you buy it is a liability.
	- Shoes, cars, weed, anything you don't need.
	- Be minimalistic, buy what you require and makes you comfortable in yourself.

3. Invest in your education
	- Books are amazing resources, I like reading free e-books before i actually invest in buying one. But once you buy one you are investing in yourself, believe in yourself and you could do it.
	- Keep learning every day, and you can't fail
	- Mom always said they can take away everything from you, but they can't take your mind.
4. Friends
	- If your friends aren't getting better with you, then they are making you worse, and you need to drop them.
	- You are your friend circle, fill it with like-minded grinders, and you will succeed, stay away from trying to drag people along with you because the more they don't want to com,, is the heavier the load.
