# TCPIP networking

RFC 1122, which defines a four-layer TCP/IP model, conflates physical and data-link layers into a single link layer, but it makes a lot of sense to separate the two. E.g. Ethernet can run on many types of physical medium, network layer interacts with Ethernet but does not need to know if there is copper or fibre underneath. Most authors use a five-layer TCP/IP model.
