# MindMap Guide

 1. Mindset 
	 1. Think of the mindmap of the edge of the puzzle, it helps you frame the idea you are trying to convey
	 2. My mindmap represents the main concepts rather than small details
	 3. The less information you try and convey the better, there should not be paragraphs of texts within your mindmap.

2. Intention 
	1. How do we intenD to use this information
	2. Consider your learning outcomes
	3. What is the goal of this mindmap, What does it represent
	4. Have I determined broad questions that my mindmap should answer, based on the learning outcomes and my intuition?
3. Keywords
	1. Find the keywords for your mindmap, look at lecture textbooks, chat gpt (dont overthink) Anything you think is important.
	2. Have a list of keywords based on your resources and knowledge
4. Chunking
	1. Take the list of keywords and group those keywords based on common traits
	2. Ask three questions how do these keywords relate
	3. What are there similarites and idfferences
	4. What is the best way to represent how they relate to the overall purpose of how I intend to use this information?
	5. I have asked myself these 3 questions and put similar keywords under common groupings
5. Mapping
	1. The Fun Part
	2. Starts with the backbone, identfy the 3-5 key co ncepts or chunks made from the prefvious steps
	3. Connect these key chunks together using the same three questions from before
		1. how do these chunks relate to each other?
		2. What are their similariteis and differences?
		3. What's the best way to represent how they relate to the overall purpose of how I intend to use this infomration?
	4. Chunk and connect the other words to the current mindmap
6. Expanding
	1. Continue to add branches to your mindmap based on your further learning from your resources, eg. lecture slides, text book
	2. Expand on these branches by adding keywords based on where it logically fits best
