# What are ACLs

An **ACL** identifies traffic based on characteristics of the packet such as source IP addres, destination IP address, port number etc..

- The router or switch can take an action based on the result of the ACL
- ACLs were originally used to determine whether packets should be allowed to traverse the network
- ACLs tell the router to identify traffic and then decide whether or not the traffic will be allowed.

Access Control List Entries
- Made up of Access Control Entries which are a series of permit or deny rules
- Each entry is written in a seperate line.
