# IT Lessons

Things I've learned from IT:

The Cost of doing upgrades don't go away if you ignore them, they accumulate.. WITH INTEREST.


Don't be a victim to the Sunk Cost fallacy, sometimes the best way is to start over.

Backup EVERYTHING, even the most insignificant thing if you have the chance. You never know when you might need it in the future, and it's always better to be safe than sorry.

If theres a will, theres a way to OpEx it.

20% of your users create 80% of your work.

Temporary fixes are usually permanant

Do it right the first time and avoid double work

Only a fool knows everything a wise man knows how little he knows

NEVER STOP LEARNING

Don't work to please everyone, work to push the business forward.

Outsource printer support or avoid them entierly


Never 'Trust' an End-Users word, they can think they are right but be absolutley and completely wrong.

IF it's painful, DO IT OFTEN.

Always have a backup plan when working in production

Don't make others poor planning your emergency

BE PROACTIVE
