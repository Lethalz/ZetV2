Apply relational prioritized learning 
Ask yourself key questions to understand conceptual relationships between the concepts you are learning.
Learn to relate everything to each other because every thing is related in some way.
Seemingly random facts will start to "hook" on to each other. 
(When i say VLAN you think Layer 2 segregation)
Use flash cards not to understand concepts but to memorize facts

Declarative knowledge - Facts, Dates, Equations, Commands 
Procedural knowledge-  Practical Usage, Methods and procedures.
(every subject you do has a certain percentage of each for example History is 80% Facts, dates, etc.. 20% procedural)

Lower Order Learning - Only require the regurgitation and recall of basic facts
Higher order Learning - Test the ability to fluidly apply, compare and contrast.

# Combinations of types and orders of knowledge: 

1. Declarative knowledge retrieved at the lower orders 
	1. Focused on the facts concepts and logic
	2. memorization
	3. Teach it to a imaginary person 
	4. Tests your basic understanding
2. Declarative knowledge retrieved at the higher orders 
	1. Fluently apply, compare and contrast 
	2. create challenge questions to test your ability to critically think about challenging subjects
3. Procedural knowledge retrieved at the lower orders 
	1. procesess and steps
	2. basic graps of procedures 
	3. practice problems, labs, basic configuration
4. Procedural knowledge retrieved at the higher orders 
	1. Fluidly adjust derive and evaluate
	1. create challenge problems to solve, break things in the lab and try to fix it. Think about what could go wrong within procedures


interleaving - understand information from multiple angles
