# Learning new things

we dont learn by putting things into our brain but pulling stuff out of our brains.

Sometimes for myself i like to activly think about some of the things ive read

The more you try to retrieve something the more your brain thinks "Hey maybe this information is actually important"


write down questions for your future self
write down use cases for things you learn
Feynman technique
How would i explain this to a 6th grader

Spaced repetition

remind your brain that something is important in the long term
**ANKI**
 
Purpose of notes

Write down important content 

Just enough to activate active recall

Use toggle lists to ask yourself questions
