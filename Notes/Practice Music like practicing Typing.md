# Practice Music like practicing Typing

When Practicing typing the key is to be accurate to solidify muscle memory, I could go as fast as I want but I would have alot of mistakes and not really be learning anything.

Practicing music is the same way, you want to focus on accuracy and form, before speed and style. Perfect practice makes perfect

"Practice makes permanent"

You cant really practice something unless youve learned it.

Use a metronome and start slow learn all the notes and rhythms

Dont practice mistakes.
