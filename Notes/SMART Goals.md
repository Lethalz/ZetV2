# SMART Goals

- **S**pecific - Ensure you are stating _specific_ goals. Example: "I will cut my restaurant budget by 25% this month."
- **M**easurable - You need to have a way to measure if you succeeded or failed. With money, this is usually pretty easy. The example above is _measurable_; if you spent $100 on restaurants this month, you've succeeded if you spend $75 or less next month.
- **A**ssignable - Usually this is assigned to you, but can be for anyone (especially if you have a family). "My spouse will maximize contributions to an IRA this year."
- **R**ealistic - Cutting your restaurant budget by 100% probably isn't achievable in one month. Gradually changing a bad habit is the best way to achieve long-term success.
- **T**ime-bound - Hold yourself accountable by setting a deadline. Goals with nebulous time frames you can adjust at will don't help you.
