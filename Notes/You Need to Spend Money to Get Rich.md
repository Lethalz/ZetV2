# You Need to Spend Money to Get Rich


 As a CEO (Remember, do your finances as if you were a Business) you have two jobs :  
1. Set up the System 
2. and Maintain it.

- This system has one overall goal, to make you money and lower the chance of you losing your money 

 - First Give Money 6 Jobs: **Emergencies, Investments, Debt, Expenses, Fun and Charity** 
 - Second Thing you need to do as CEO is ( Pick a Goal and Financial Freedom  ) Most people when they get started **they want to invest** (but that’s a mistake) You know that saying ,**don’t borrow from peter to pay Paul, because you’re pretty much left in a worst or same position as before)** 
 
 - So if you Are Debt you **pay off the debt first**, because its costing you money, and investing will make you money but with the money debt is costing you ( you’re not really making progress )
 - So Here what you want: Pay Debt First, 
 - Save for emergencies Second,
 - Invest and buy/payoff a house 3rd 
 - and forth enjoy the wealth
