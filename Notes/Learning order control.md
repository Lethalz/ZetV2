# Learning order control

There are varying levels of difficulty with any topic, to be efficient don't get stuck on what's hard but mark it while you're still learning the easy stuff so that you can go back to it for better comprehension. 
Also , Don't be afraid to reword whats being said to make it make more sense to you.
