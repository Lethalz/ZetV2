# VPN Tunnel ELI5

Think of the original data in a vpn tunnel as the letter that you put inside an envelope.

The envelope is the VPN encapsulation protocol.

The letter inside has a sender and a receiver but the envelope also has a sender and receiver the outside is all the postal carriers can see. 

In this case the postal carriers are Routers that are not VPN endpoints.

Lets say in order to open this envelope we need a code but only the sender and receiver has this code. 

No matter what only the VPN endpoints can "open" the envelope 

the reason we call this a "Tunnel" is because the original data can only be seen at the ends of the tunnel.
