# How Learning Works: Memory and Neural Connections

> [!info] Core Concept
> Memory formation requires active engagement and meaningful connections to existing knowledge, strengthened through [[The Talent Code|myelin]] development.

## Memory Types
- **Short-term memory**: Brief retention (seconds)
- **Working memory**: Active processing space
- **Long-term memory**: Durable storage

## Creating Strong Memories
1. **Activate Working Memory**
  - Give information purpose
  - Process actively
  - "Load the bullet in the chamber"

2. **Build Connections**
  - Link to existing knowledge
  - Create meaningful associations
  - Enable easier retrieval

> [!note] Why We Forget
> Brain filters out "meaningless" information. This selectivity makes important memories more significant.

## Strengthening Neural Pathways
- [[Make it Stick|Myelin]] wraps around neural connections
- Strengthens with repeated use
- Built through [[The Talent Code|deep practice]]
- Reinforced by active recall (flashcards)

> [!tip] Application
> Use retrieval practice and spaced repetition to build myelin and strengthen memory connections
