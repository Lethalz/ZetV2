	- You will need all this information to possibly track down a bad tenant.
	- Not asking for social security number 

> [!Caution]
> Dont ask for a applicant's DOB, they can possibly use that as ammo for a age discrimination lawsuit

Make sure potential tenants sign the rental application!
After Tenant signs one application create a copy of the last page and have them sign and date it as well.

Seperate form for Consent to contact references and Perform Credit Check form needs to be signed as well: [CheckConsent.rtf](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AgCI7DLgcU9MjiS8B1_nxItif_IN?e=UIuJ7R)


### Proof of Identity

Prospective tenants need to show their drivers liscense or state ID to **verify that applicant are using their real name.**

>[!Note]
>When met with a impatient, desperate person who may need a place immediately, don't fall for it.  That in itself is a sign of poor planning. However life does happen, tread carefully.

### Check with Current and Previous Landlords and Other References

**Always** call current and previous landlords or managers for reference.
Letters are never good enough, get it straight from the horses mouth.

### Verify Income and Employment

Debts + Income = About 1/3 or less for rent if possible

### Do a credit Check

## Denying a applicant

If we decide to deny a applicant, write a formal letter expalining exactly why they word denied and remember it can't be any discriminatory reasons like race, age religion.

You may legally reject a tenant based on legitamet business concerns things like:

- Bad credit
- unsteady employment
- Or too low of an income to debt ratio to pay rent

### Red Flags

- Alot of debts
- Bad references
- no co-signer
- can't afford the deposit
- No steps to improve credit
-
## If we reject based on credit report

We must provide the instituition like Equifax, etc..
