# Radio Frequency Explained

## Fundamental Concepts

### Hertz (Hz)

- Measurement of frequency change over one second
- 1 Hz = 1 cycle per second

### Radio Frequency

- Type of Electromagnetic Radiation (EMR)
- Key characteristics:
    - Contains both electrical and magnetic properties
    - Propagates without medium or cable
    - Can travel through vacuum of space
    - Has detectable waveform (oscillates)
    - Oscillation measured in Hertz
    - Radio frequency = measurement of EMR oscillation

## ISM Bands (Industrial, Scientific, and Medical)

### Characteristics

- EMR oscillates at specific frequencies
- All EMR frequency bands have designated labels
- ISM bands assigned by US FCC (Federal Communications Commission)
- Unlicensed bands for industrial, scientific, and medical use

### Frequency Behavior

- Higher Frequencies:
    - More prone to attenuation
    - Limited wall penetration
    - Faster data transmission
- Lower Frequencies:
    - Less attenuation
    - Better wall penetration
    - Slower data transmission

### ISM Band Limitations

- Unlicensed usage
- Open to public use
- Potential for interference from multiple users/devices

### Important ISM Bands for WiFi

- 2.4 GHz band
    - Better range
    - More prone to interference
- 5 GHz band
    - Higher speeds
    - Less interference
    - Limited range
