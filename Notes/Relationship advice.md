# Relationship advice

No matter what personal preference you have there are some universal "red flags" that any perspective dater should be looking out for:

1. **Emotional Stability**: When one or both partners are emotionally stable, they are better able to handle the ups and downs of a relationship and work through challenges and conflicts in a healthy way. This can help build trust and deepen the connection between partners.
2. **Loyalty**: When one partner is loyal to the other, it demonstrates that they are committed to the relationship and willing to stand by their partner through thick and thin. You can tell if someone is loyal or not by the long-term friendships they have in their life.
3. **Growth Mindset**: You both should always be looking to be better because that is life's conquest in my eyes. Someone with a growth mindset believes that their abilities and characteristics can be developed and improved over time through effort and learning. They are open to new experiences and challenges, and are willing to take risks and learn from their mistakes.
4. **Decision-Making:** Decision-making is an important skill in any relationship because it involves being able to weigh the options and make choices that are in the best interest of the relationship and both partners. In a healthy relationship, both partners should feel comfortable expressing their opinions and preferences, and should be able to work together to make decisions that are mutually beneficial. This may involve open and honest communication, active listening, and a willingness to compromise.

## Falling in Love and Being in Love

**Falling in love and being in love are two different stages of a romantic relationship.

- **Falling in love** is often described as an *intense, passionate feeling* that is associated with the beginning of a relationship. It can be characterized by *strong feelings of attraction*, *infatuation, and excitement.* Falling in love often involves a strong emotional and physical connection, and can be an all-consuming experience.
- **Being in love**, on the other hand, is a *deeper, more enduring form* of love that develops over time. It involves a strong emotional and physical connection, but it also involves a *deep level of trust, respect, and commitment.* Being in love involves caring for and supporting your partner, and being willing to work through challenges and conflicts together.**

## Attachment theory

There are 3 main types of attachment

1. **Anxiously attached**: These people have a fear of their partner *abandoning* them and constantly want to be in touch with them.
2.  **Avoidant attached**: These people have a fear that they will be smothered by the relationship and constantly pulling back from intimacy.
3.   **Securely attached**: These people are comfortable with intimacy, but also comfortable with their independence.
**Securely attached people are about 50% of the population but because theyâ€™re good at relationships, they tend to be taken and are good at making relationships work**
