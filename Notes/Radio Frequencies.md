# Radio Frequencies


wifi signals- Electromagnetic waves that are manipulated to encode data 


the wave ocillate or change at predictable rates called frequency
certain ranges of frequency are termed radio frequencies 
how many times over a certtain amount of time has a radio wave changed is what frequency is 


wifi transmittesrs have dcontrol ove rthis ratge of oscillation ie freuqency

only ceritan ferequencies ha ebeen sallocate dfor use

ISM Bands
certain lslices acan be used for free
emr oscillates at scetain frequencies
all emr frewquency badnds have eben given labes 
Ism bands 
(mabe do a mermaid graph of these bands)


spread spectrum

some wireless transmission emthods send data across a very narrow ferequency band but at high power
this is called narrowband transmission
easy to block or jam

were spreading our message out over multiple frequencies


802.11 wifi techniques spread the signal across mulitple frequencies utilizing lower poer
thi sis called spread spectrume
so instead of using one high freuqncy band to send a message it will send varying types of frquencies 
more resistant ot interference or blocking

encoding and modulation

as data bits are passed down to the wifi phuysical laye two things happen to them: bits are encoded into a pattern and these encoded messages are modulated int rf transmissions

even if you get 85% of a pattern you still can figure out what the message was


Chipping and coding


in early forms of 802.11 a signle bit would  be expanded into a multi bit patter prior to transmission 
the method used was called chipping and  ertain chipping seuqences were utilized

depending on the datarate dirfferent chiping codes were utilized against single data bits to dcreate chip squences
barker code a way of taking a sing bit of a one or zero and creating a sequence out of it
	used in mbps and 2 mbps datarates
	resulted in a 11 bit chip squence for each data bit to be transmitted
