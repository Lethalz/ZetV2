1.  **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**: IaaS is a cloud computing model in which a provider offers infrastructure components like servers, storage, and networking on a pay-per-use basis. Customers can provision virtual machines and other resources on demand, and have control over the operating system, applications, and data. Some examples of IaaS providers include Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform.
    
2.  **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**: PaaS is a cloud computing model in which a provider offers a platform for customers to develop, run, and manage their own applications, without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure. The provider manages the infrastructure, operating system, and middleware, while the customer focuses on developing and deploying their own applications. Some examples of PaaS providers include Heroku, Google App Engine, and Microsoft Azure App Service.
    
3.  **Software as a Service (SaaS)**: SaaS is a cloud computing model in which a provider hosts and delivers software applications over the internet. Customers can access the software through a web browser or app, without having to install or maintain the software on their own computers or devices. The provider manages the infrastructure, platform, and application, while the customer uses the software to perform specific tasks or functions. Some examples of SaaS providers include Salesforce, Microsoft Office 365, and Dropbox.
