# MSP growth

MSP growth 

1. Build out a **Marketing plan** or pay someone to do it, Cold calling, email blasts, social media, web marketing, etc…
	- At some point when possible, we need a “sales engine”—dedicated resources working on sales 100% of the time.
	- We can grow to a **couple million** just by referrals and giving the best work possible, but eventually we will stall, and if we aren't growing we are shrinking
	- **Hire a Dedicated Sales Manager**
		- Not in the tradition sense, he needs to be a New business seller but also a Solution seller.
		- When the CEO is the main seller it makes the business look small, so instantly that loses out on certain high-echelon businesses.
		- Nothing beats a Sales Manager being able to escalate to a CEO as a leverage strategy.

## Action:


2. Be committed to being a **full stack msp** , That comes with being up-to-date with technology;
	- IT and cloud Tech—Cloud we should use AWS, it is the standard
	- Security; have a couple models customers can choose from; zero-trust, partial trust , only what they require.
	- Customer Service-- We got that in the bag
	- Customization for each business—being able to provide tech services unique to each of those businesses
	- Onboarding—we should have a timeline and cost associated with bringing us onboard. 
	- Cost—Of service, and maybe get some ideas of what other MSP's are charging/

## Action: 
	



3. Optimize our current offerings : Recognize what is missing and fill that hole, account management, automation, service, cloud, etc…


## Action:


4.  *Sell relationships not products*, just like how an ISP has a Customer Acquisition cost our customers have a Business acquisition cost, so the more comfortable they are
the less likely they are to  change partners because it's cheaper for them. 
- **Get them to happy**, should be our goal, once they are happy they are set.

## Action: 

5. **Jay needs to focus on the business, not in the business**, we need to set up a timeline to make that happen, If you spend part-time growing the business you're going to get part-time growth,
 *“you’re the business owner signing up new clients or doing sales then you’re resigning the sales function in your business to a ‘part-time’ role, which gives you ‘part-time results’.* “

## Action: 

6. We need to sell options for our managed support and network upgrades. We want them engaged in choosing an option, rather than being sold one thing with no wiggle-room or leeway.
	      - If you increase your sales conversion of new support deals, you grow.
	      - conversion is your lead-to-acquisition rate, if we get more leads but dont acquire those new leads has anything changed
	      - improve your **support proposal, your options, your pitch, your presentation** to increase conversion.
	      - Keep busy, then optimize that busyness

## Action: 

7. Your clients are also new leads, Plant the seed of upgrading into your new and current customers, show them the importance of keeping tech updated. This is called “farming". 
 -  Communication is the best way you can farm your customers. Ask them how your product/service as been helping their business, find out if there is anything else you can help them with, then talk about your opportunities for new services or upgrades!

## Action: 



9. Work with third-party sellers to get your customers the best discounts you can, and if possible provide options with multiple different vendors. This will add revenue and its win-win for the client and you.

## Action: 

10. Referrals : Do a great job and our customers will refer us. We need to offer a memorable experience every time we work, and the customers will tell their colleagues and friends.
		From the research I've done, actually doing referral campaigns is a no-no , focus on the **customer experience**, and we'll be surprised at how many referrals we get.
	- One plan for customer experience could be to set up a Desktop and/or mobile app for easy communication.
	- Find a way to keep company branding in-front of the customer, whether that's coffee mugs, lanyards , pens, wallpapers, always be subtly around.

## Action: 

# Understanding Monetization
-   Price isn't a number. It's the **perceived value** that your product holds for the customer.
-   Price is both an indication of what customers value and a measure of much they are willing to pay for that value.
-   **How you charge is often more important than how much you charge**.
-   Pricing sends a signal about **quality.**



## DESIGNING PRODUCT AROUND PRICE

-   Smart companies design the product around the price.
-   Be willing to remove features that customers don't value.
-   Don't default to giving away value-added functionality. Customers will pay for it.
-   Don't force a one-size-fits-all solution. Customers are different, so segment them.
-   Fewer features sometimes creates more demand by highlighting the things that matter.

## PRICING STRATEGY IN PRACTICE

-  Understand your customers' overall willingness-to-pay for your product.
-   Second, understand how much value customers place on each feature and what they would be willing to pay for that value. Review and Learn about "why"
-   Ask direct questions about your product and its feature during interviews.
-   Anchor your prices to low or high extremes. Low for market , High for quality.
-   Maintain pricing integrity. Control discounting and avoid price cuts.
