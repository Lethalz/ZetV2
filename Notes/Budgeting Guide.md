# Budgeting

Budgeting is the foundation of your financial house. You should focus on tracking all of your expenses for the month, using a method of your choice listed below in the [Tools/Systems](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/budgeting#wiki_tools.2Fsystems) section. Having a budget will help you allocate your money more effectively and make it easier to reach your financial goals.

## Creating a Budget

1. **Income**: Start with listing your monthly income, either four weeks or 30 days of after-tax pay. If you're starting a new job and planning ahead, use an [after-tax paycheck calculator](https://www.adp.com/resources/tools/calculators/salary-paycheck-calculator.aspx) to get some rough numbers.
    
    - If you're paid twice per month, you might want to grab your February pay stubs (or a calculator) and see what 10 workdays of pay looks like, then multiply by two. This will help you budget out the worst-case scenario.
    - If your monthly income fluctuates, try to base your budget on a worst-case or lower-than-average scenario. In months where you have extra money left over, that can be used to increase your savings or pay down debts.
2. **Needs**: Once you have after-tax pay, list out each of your "needs" and how much each one costs. This includes any kind of _mandatory spending_, anything related to safety and survival and includes:
    
    - Mortgage, rent, and insurance
    - Electric, natural gas, water, and any other utilities
    - Groceries
    - Transportation
    - Health care costs, health insurance, etc.
3. **Wants**: After documenting your needs, look at your "wants". This is your _discretionary spending_ on non-essential expenses such as dining out, entertainment, hobbies, and shopping. Try to be specific with each item using categories that aren't overly broad such as:
    
    - Cable or streaming
    - Dining out, bars, and clubs
    - Gym memberships, sports, hobbies, etc.
    - Shopping  
        
4. **Saving and Debt Repayment**: This is the portion of your budget that goes to _"future you"_. It includes paying off debts, saving for future goals, and saving for retirement. Try to follow the steps in the [Prime Directive](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics) article for guidance on how to allocate extra money.
    
5. **Review**: Go through your spending make sure you've included every expense in a spending category in your your budget.
    
    - Check your credit card and debit card statements for anything you might have missed.
    - Try to mentally run through all of the places where you've spent cash and make a realistic estimate for each of those expenses. If that's difficult, start writing down your cash expenses _today_ and keep at it for at least a month.
    - Finally, try to take into account other non-monthly expenses. You can try to estimate the monthly average cost for non-monthly expenses so they can be included in your monthly budget or you can put them into a separate section of your budget.

The purpose of this process is to understand where your money is going so you can pinpoint problem areas, get feedback from others (if you need help from the community, make a post!), and identify opportunities to reduce spending if needed.

## Guidance

Once you've created a budget, these guidelines can help you evaluate your budget and further expose areas that might need improvement or adjustment.

### 50/30/20 Budget Rule

The 50/30/20 budgeting rule is a simple budgeting strategy to help you prioritize your financial goals:

- **50% for Needs**: Allocate 50% of your income to cover essential expenses like housing, utilities, groceries, and transportation.
    
- **30% for Wants**: Allocate 30% of your income for discretionary spending and non-essential expenses like dining out, entertainment, hobbies, and shopping.
    
- **20% for Savings and Debt Repayment**: Allocate 20% of your income towards savings, investments, and paying down debts.
    

The purpose of this system is to make sure your essential needs are met, you have room for discretionary expenses, and you prioritize saving for the future and managing your debts.

These percentages are not set in stone. If money is tight, you may need to allocate a higher percentage of your income to needs. If you have significant debt, you might choose to allocate more than 20% toward debt repayment to accelerate your progress. Similarly, if you have ambitious savings goals, you can allocate a higher percentage to savings.

### Red Flags

You should consider making changes to your lifestyle if any of the following is the case with your budget:

- Your monthly mortgage/rent is more than 30% of your take home pay. You might want to consider getting a roommate, or moving to some place cheaper.
- Your total monthly expenses on your vehicle is more than 15% of your take home pay. You might want to consider carpooling to work, traveling less, or taking the bus or a bike. You may also want to consider moving closer or selling your car, if either is an option. 10% of your monthly budget is a healthier number for vehicle spending. The [vehicles wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/vehicles) has additional guidance.
- Your groceries cost more than $300 per person. If you're trying to cut costs, you might want to look at more frugal options for buying groceries, such as buying in bulk, going for store-brand foods, or frequenting less expensive grocery stores.

## Budgeting Systems and Tools

Figure out a system that works for you. Pen and paper works, but there are also a lot of commercial, freemium, free, and open source tools out there.

### Free Spreadsheets

Some of the most popular free options on [/r/personalfinance](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance) are several user-created spreadsheets listed on the [tools wiki page](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/tools). The _[Spreadsheet for people who don't know how to budget!](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/tools#wiki_budgeting)_ is very popular.

### Commercial Software

- [Mint](https://www.mint.com/) is free and automates much of the process by linking up with most large financial institutions to help track your spending and other aspects of your finances.
    
- [Personal Capital](https://www.personalcapital.com/) (Empower Personal Dashboard) is free and automates much of the process by linking up with most large financial institutions to help track your spending and other aspects of your finances. (You might want to consider signing up with a Google Voice or other non-primary phone number because [sales calls seem to be an issue for some people](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/8ko8y1/personal_capital_calling/).)
    
- [YNAB](http://www.youneedabudget.com/) is commonly recommended, but it is a [subscription service](https://www.youneedabudget.com/pricing/) with monthly and annual plans. Students with a `.edu` e-mail address can get one annual subscription to YNAB for free.
    

### Open Source Software

There are also several popular free and open source tools worth considering:

(These are listed in alphabetical order.)

- [GnuCash](https://www.gnucash.org/) is "personal and small-business financial-accounting software, freely licensed under the GNU GPL". According to the [GnuCash wiki](https://wiki.gnucash.org/wiki/Using_GnuCash): "GnuCash is a complex piece of software with many features and possibilities. It requires some learning and experience to work fluently and effectively with it." Also check out [/r/GnuCash](https://www.reddit.com/r/GnuCash).
- [HomeBank](http://homebank.free.fr/en/) is "Free, easy, personal accounting, for everyone".
- [Money Manager Ex](https://www.moneymanagerex.org/) is "free, open-source, cross-platform, easy-to-use personal finance software".

### The Envelope System

Once you have your budget in place, using the envelope system can be a good way to stick to your budget. Decide what spending categories you want to try to control using the envelope system. Typically any area where you overspend is a good one to use. For many people this might be food, clothing, and entertainment. For each of those categories go to the bank or ATM and withdraw your budgeted amount in cash. Take an envelope and write the name of the category on the front of the envelope and put the money inside. From then on, whenever you spend money in this category it must come from that envelope. If you don't use the money for that month leave it in there and add your budgeted amount again next month. If you are consistently not spending the money maybe you want to adjust your budget. Some things you just don't buy every month though. People tend to buy clothes seasonally, for example.

The advantage of the envelope system is it makes you stop and think. If you're at the store and want to buy something, you look in the envelope. If the envelope is empty you know that buying that item would put you over budget. If you're half way through the month and have spent more than half your food money it may not be a good idea to go out to eat that night. Is that toy really worth half of your entertainment budget for the month? It can also help those that have a hard time _spending_ money. If you open the food envelope and there is more than enough money for the rest of the month, you can feel better about going out with your friends.

## Cutting your Spending Meaningfully

Once you have begun to track all of your expenses carefully, you will begin to notice where to make appropriate cuts, good places to shift your resources, and other goals you might want to make. _You_ get to decide what is meaningful.

Benjamin Franklin once said, "A penny saved is a penny earned." If this is true, then a budget cut is the same thing as increasing your income.

Your goals and cuts should be **SMART**:

- **S**pecific - Ensure you are stating _specific_ goals. Example: "I will cut my restaurant budget by 25% this month."
- **M**easurable - You need to have a way to measure if you succeeded or failed. With money, this is usually pretty easy. The example above is _measurable_; if you spent $100 on restaurants this month, you've succeeded if you spend $75 or less next month.
- **A**ssignable - Usually this is assigned to you, but can be for anyone (especially if you have a family). "My spouse will maximize contributions to an IRA this year."
- **R**ealistic - Cutting your restaurant budget by 100% probably isn't achievable in one month. Gradually changing a bad habit is the best way to achieve long-term success.
- **T**ime-bound - Hold yourself accountable by setting a deadline. Goals with nebulous time frames you can adjust at will don't help you.

Oft-cited ways to reduce spending are to cut cable, reduce cell phone plans to a minute/data level you actually use, cook at home/bring lunch to work, refinance a loan, cut coupons, de-link credit cards from online shopping sites, reduce use of your credit card & substitute cash, turn off lights when not in use, turn down the heat/air conditioning when not at home or sleeping, etc.
