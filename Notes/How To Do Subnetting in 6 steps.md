# How To Do Subnetting in 6 steps

To implement subnets, follow this procedure:

1.Determine the IP address for your network as assigned by the registry authority or network administrator.

2.Based on your organizational and administrative structure, determine the number of subnets that are required for the network. Be sure to plan for growth.

3.Based on the required number of subnets, determine the number of bits that you need to borrow from the host bits.

4.Determine the binary and decimal value of the new subnet mask that results from borrowing bits from the host ID.

5.Apply the subnet mask to the network IP address to determine the subnets and the available host addresses. Also, determine the network and broadcast addresses for each subnet.

6.Assign subnet addresses to all subnets. Assign host addresses to all devices that are connected to each subnet.
