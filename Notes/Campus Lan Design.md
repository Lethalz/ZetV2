### Access Layer:

-   The Access layer is the first layer in the network design and it is responsible for connecting end devices (such as computers, printers, and IP phones) to the network.
-   This layer is typically designed with switches that provide Layer 2 connectivity to the end devices, and is also responsible for controlling access to the network resources through features such as VLANs and port security.
-   The Access layer switches are connected to the Distribution layer switches using uplink ports.

### Distribution Layer:

-   The Distribution layer is the second layer in the network design and it is responsible for aggregating traffic from the Access layer switches and forwarding it to the Core layer switches.
-   This layer is typically designed with switches that provide Layer 3 connectivity and routing services between the Access layer switches and the Core layer switches.
-   The Distribution layer switches are also responsible for implementing policies such as Quality of Service (QoS), access control, and link aggregation.

### Core Layer:

-   The Core layer is the third and final layer in the network design and it is responsible for providing high-speed switching and routing services between the Distribution layer switches.
-   This layer is typically designed with high-performance switches that provide Layer 3 connectivity and routing services between the Distribution layer switches.
-   The Core layer switches are responsible for providing a high degree of availability and redundancy, as well as implementing advanced features such as load balancing, multicast routing, and security policies.
