# Spanning tree Terminology


Hubs were layer 1 devices which performed the same funtion as switches but they did not learn MAC  address so they flooded 'all' traffic out of all ports
Early switches were expensive with few ports and were called 'bridges'

It bridged two hub networks.
A bridge is a multi-port bridge

Spanning tree was invented when bridges were still in use. Hence the 'bridge' Terminology still in use
