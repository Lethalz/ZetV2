# How to keep a car running for 500k miles


Summary:
1. 100k miles - change coolant fluids on spill and fill (drain reservoir and radiator not the block) then every 50k thereafter 

2. Every 100k miles - change water pump 
3. Every 5k miles - change oil and oil filter 
4. Every 50k miles - change transmission fluid, change transmission fluid every 100k miles
5. Every 100k miles - serpentine belt and/or timing belt 
6. Every 100k miles - change spark plugs 
7. Every 3 years - change brake fluid 
8. Every 200k - change hoses
9. Every 1 year - Fluid Film, Krown or NH Oil Undercoating. Wet treatments for under car. Wool wax or lanolin based product. to protect against salt. Then drive down dirt road to get the dust to bond to the underside. 
10. Every 150k - struts, sway bar links, alignment. ($1200 parts and labor)
11. Every 30k - change air filter 
12. Every 1 year - change cabin air filter
13. Every 1 year - inspect exhaust (take it to an exhaust shop)
14. Every 6 months - weather stripping - spray with silicone treatment
15. Every 3 months - wax the paint 
16. Small Failures: valve cover leaks, coil failures, intake manifold leaks, throttle positioning sensor, mass airflow sensor, ECM failure, ABS pump failure, valve timing (click and tick), wheel bearing failure, ABS sensor failure, axel failure, caliper failure 
17. Big Failures: transmission ($4k parts and labor)
