# Radio Frequency Modulation



The carrier signal 

Carrier signal = a particular frequency(s) selected on which to transmit data 

Much like a car has to be tuned into a particular station to hear specific music (data)

Both transmitter and the reciever needs to be using the same carrier signal

The carrier signal is modified in predicatble ways to send this data and that is called modulation



What is modulation?

The properties of a radio frequency that we can change over time to encode data into a carrier signal.
