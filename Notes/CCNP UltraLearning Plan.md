# CCNP UltraLearning Plan


# CCNP ENCOR Ultralearning Plan

## 1. Metalearning

- Use the Cisco Exam Objectives as your primary guide for content structure.
- Create a mind map or spreadsheet outlining all major topics and subtopics.
- Estimate time needed for each section based on your current knowledge and the topic's complexity.

## 2. Focus

- Implement the Pomodoro technique: 25-minute focused study sessions followed by 5-minute breaks.
- Create a distraction-free study environment.
- Use website blockers during study time to maintain focus.

## 3. Directness

- Utilize your CML (Cisco Modeling Labs) environment for hands-on practice.
- Create a lab schedule that aligns with your theoretical study topics.
- Aim to spend at least 30% of your study time on hands-on labs.

## 4. Drill

- Identify weak areas through practice tests and self-assessment.
- Create focused drills for complex topics or areas where you struggle.
- Use the "time slicing" method to break down complex procedures into smaller, manageable parts.

## 5. Retrieval

- Continue using Quizlet for flashcards.
- Implement the "question-book method": Take notes by rephrasing content into questions and answers.
- Practice free recall: After each study session, write down everything you remember without referring to materials.

## 6. Feedback

- Regularly take practice tests from Boson ExSim to gauge your progress.
- Analyze incorrect answers to identify knowledge gaps.
- Utilize your Discord study group for peer feedback and discussion of complex topics.

## 7. Retention

- Implement spaced repetition in your flashcard practice.
- Review key concepts at increasing intervals (1 day, 3 days, 1 week, 2 weeks, etc.).
- Create mind maps or diagrams to visualize and connect different topics.

## 8. Intuition

- For each major topic, try to explain it in simple terms as if teaching someone else.
- Seek out real-world examples of how CCNP ENCOR concepts are applied in network environments.
- Regularly challenge yourself with "what if" scenarios to deepen your understanding.

## 9. Experimentation

- Alternate between different learning resources (videos, books, labs) to find what works best for each topic.
- Try different study techniques (e.g., Feynman Technique, Cornell Note-Taking) and assess their effectiveness.
- Adjust your study plan based on your progress and feedback from practice tests.

## Daily Schedule (3-4 hours)

1. Warm-up (10 minutes): Review flashcards from previous sessions
2. Main study block (2 hours):
    - 25 min video lecture or book reading
    - 5 min break
    - 25 min hands-on lab or practice questions
    - 5 min break
    - Repeat
3. Active recall session (20 minutes): Free writing or self-testing on the day's topic
4. Lab work (30-60 minutes): Practical application in CML
5. Cool-down (10 minutes): Summarize key learnings, update flashcards

## Weekly Schedule

- Monday-Friday: Follow daily schedule
- Saturday: Extended lab session and practice tests
- Sunday: Review weak areas identified during the week, plan for the next week

## Progress Tracking

- Keep a study journal to log daily progress and insights
- Take a practice test every two weeks to measure improvement
- Reassess and adjust your study plan monthly based on progress and any changing needs
