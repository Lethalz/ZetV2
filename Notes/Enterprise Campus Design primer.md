# Enterprise Campus Design primer



Questions to ask when building out a Campus network.

### Access Layer

What are the current and future needs for end-users or node ports in the existing wiring closets of that particular building?

 What kind of hardware can the company or the client afford? Can it afford modular devices?

Is the existing cabling adequate? Do you have C5 or Cat6 UTP cabling? Can you afford fiber cabling?

What are the performance and bandwidth requirments

What level of high availability is needed at the Access Layer?

What are the requirements to support  VLAN, VTP, and STP?

What are the Layer 2 traffic patterns for appplications

What multicasting needs and Qos Services are necessary at layer 2?


### Distribution Layer 

Should Layer 2 or Layer 3 switches be used? 

How many total users will you have to support 

500>  L3 switches needed 


What are the high availibility needs?

Are the distribution layer switches modular and scalable?

What types of intelligence services will be used in the distribution layer?

Is the company prepared to anage and configure the distribution layer block? 

Should training or consultancy be added to the project budget to ensure that this particular block will be properly managed?

Will adv STP features be implemented?
not needed with layer 3 switches 


#### Core/ Backbone

Do you have three or more separeate locations in the campus that are connected through an enterprise campus infrastructure?

Based on the present infrastructure will the solution to the campus backbone be a layer 2 layer2/4 or layer 3 switching solution 

In the case of a large enterprise campus, do you have the budget for a full multilayer backbone solution throughout?

Is the organization ready for a high performace multilayer switching enciornment?
- do they know how to run it , do they have the manpower to run it

Does the customer wan tto simplify and lower the number of links between distribution layer swithes and the server farm block/edge distribution submodule? 

What are the prformance needs?


How many high-capacity links/ports are neceessary for the campus backbone block? 

What are the high availability/redundancy demands?
