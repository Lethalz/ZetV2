# APIPA Addressing

 APIPA assigns a class B IP address from 169.254.0.0 to 169.254.255.255 to the client when a DHCP server is either permanently or temporarily unavailable. 
	 Designed for small non-routable networks, if a DHCP server becomes available later, the APIPA address is replaced with one from the DHCP server.

**Used in troubleshooting to find out if DHCP is down.**
Allows two computers on the same segmented network or hardwired to speak with each other.
