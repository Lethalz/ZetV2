## My Questions



If I were to join your team today, what specific contributions or initiatives could I undertake to make a positive impact and enhance the team's overall performance?


Standard questions:

**Q1: Describe a time when you had to troubleshoot a complex network issue under pressure. How did you approach the problem, and what was the outcome?**

There was  time at all IT where I was dispatched to a Mental hospital, along with looking at the job description, I like to speak with the users on site to get a different picture of the situation. After talking with them, I learned that it was intermittant network issues but the key part was that it would happen during peak hours. Which led me to the assumption that it was either DHCP IP pool exhaustion or banwidth problems on the network. So I whipped out wireshark and checked out some of the packets that i was getting on my labtop after i linked into the network and lo and behold I was not getting a response back from the DHCP server after putting out a DHCP request.


**Q2: Can you talk about a project where you had to design and implement a new network solution? What were your design considerations, and how did you ensure the project's success?**

_Creative Answer:_ "At Hardwired Technologies, I led a project to overhaul an outdated LAN for a client with growing bandwidth and security needs. The project involved deploying Cisco Meraki switches and firewalls, integrating VLANs for network segmentation, and implementing 802.1X for secure network access. One of the key design considerations was scalability, ensuring the network could support future growth in both users and applications. To ensure success, I engaged stakeholders in the planning phase to align the network design with business objectives, conducted rigorous testing of the new configurations in a sandbox environment, and provided comprehensive training to the IT staff. The project was delivered on time and within budget, resulting in enhanced performance, security, and scalability for the client."
