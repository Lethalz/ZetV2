### The need for hexadecimal numbers

In computing systems, the binary string equivalents of large decimal numbers can become quite long. When 16-bit or 32-bit numbers are involved, it becomes difficult to read and write them without producing errors. These problems can be overcome by arranging the binary numbers into groups of four bits, i.e., by using the hexadecimal numbering system.

- large binary numbers in fewer digits
- more compact
- easier to understand                            

In hex, four digits of a binary number can be represented by a single hex digit.

- each set can have a possible value of between 0000 and 1111
