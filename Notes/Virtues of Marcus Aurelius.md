8. **Mortality and the Transience of Life**: Marcus frequently reflected on the fleeting nature of life and the inevitability of death. This wasn't morbid but rather a reminder to live virtuously and appreciate the present.
    
9. **Cosmopolitanism**: He believed in the idea that all humans are citizens of the world and that we should act for the greater good of all, not just for our own narrow interests.
    
10. **Inner Peace**: Throughout his writings, Marcus emphasizes the importance of inner tranquility. He believed that by focusing on virtue and rationality, one could achieve a state of inner peace regardless of external circumstances.
