# TLS Session Resumption - Corrected

## Initial Handshake Process

1. Client Hello:
   - Client sends a Session ID field filled with zeros

2. Server Hello:
   - Server generates and sends a random Session ID

This process establishes a Session ID for potential future resumption.

## Session Resumption Process

1. Client Hello:
   - Client sends the previously received Session ID

2. Server Hello:
   - If agreeing to resume: Server sends back the same Session ID
   - If declining resumption: Server generates and sends a new random Session ID

The server has the final say in whether to resume a session. It may decline for various reasons, including security policies or if it has discarded the session information.
```

## Key Points

- Session resumption aims to reduce the overhead of full TLS handshakes
- The client initiates the resumption by sending a previously used Session ID
- The server's response determines whether the session is resumed or a full handshake is required
- If resumed, both parties can use information from the previous session to quickly establish a secure connection

## Benefits of Correct Implementation

1. Reduced latency: Fewer round trips required
2. Lower computational overhead: Avoids full cryptographic negotiations
3. Improved user experience: Faster connection establishment

While session resumption improves performance, it's important to balance this with security needs. Servers should implement appropriate policies for session lifetime and rotation.
