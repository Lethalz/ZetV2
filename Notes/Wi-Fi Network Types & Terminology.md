# Wi-Fi Network Types & Terminology



# WiFi Network Types & Terminology Guide

## Network Types

### 1. Ad-Hoc Networks
- Direct point-to-point communication between WiFi clients
- No access points required
- Limited use cases
- Primarily for temporary connections

### 2. Infrastructure Networks
- Utilizes access points for coordination
- Centralized management of multiple clients
- Most common deployment type
- Provides structured network access

### 3. Mesh Networks
- Access points interconnected in daisy-chain configuration
- Client data relays through multiple APs to reach wired network
- Common in outdoor deployments
- Used where wired Ethernet isn't feasible

#### Mesh Network Limitations
- Single-device transmission limitation
- Performance degradation with each AP hop
- Inverse relationship between mesh size and performance
- Bandwidth sharing across mesh nodes

## Essential WiFi Terminology

### BSS (Basic Service Set)
- Fundamental building block of WiFi network
- Encompasses:
  - Single access point
  - Defined coverage area
  - Transmission/reception range

### BSSID (Basic Service Set Identifier)
- Unique identifier for access point
- Uses MAC address format
- Distinguishes between multiple APs

### SSID (Service Set Identifier)
- User-configurable WLAN name
- Network identification for clients
- Broadcast or hidden options

### Distribution System (DS)
- Underlying wired network infrastructure
- Connects multiple access points
- Provides backbone connectivity

### ESS (Extended Service Set)
- Multiple access points sharing:
  - Common distribution system
  - Same WLAN service
  - Seamless connectivity

### ESSID (Extended Service Set Identifier)
- Equivalent to SSID
- Used in extended network contexts
- Identifies multiple AP networks
