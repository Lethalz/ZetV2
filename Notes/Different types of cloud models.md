# Different types of cloud models



#### Public Cloud: 

A **public cloud** is a type of cloud computing that provides computing resources like servers, storage, and applications over the internet, which are owned and operated by a third-party cloud service provider. These resources are shared among multiple users and customers, and you only pay for what you use.

##### Pros:

-   **Cost-effective:** You only pay for the resources you use, which can save money over owning and maintaining your own hardware.
-   **Scalability**: Resources can be easily scaled up or down according to your needs.
-   **Flexibility**: Public cloud providers offer a wide range of services and applications that can be quickly and easily deployed.

##### Cons:

-   **Security**: Data security can be a concern since resources are shared among multiple users.
-   **Dependence:** You are dependent on the provider for availability and performance.
-   **Compliance:** Compliance with regulations and standards can be a challenge since data is stored on a third-party server.

#### Private Cloud:
A private cloud is a type of cloud computing that provides computing resources like servers, storage, and applications that are dedicated to a single organization. The organization can build, operate, and manage the private cloud on its own premises or through a third-party provider.

##### Pros:

-   Control: The organization has complete control over the cloud infrastructure and security.
-   Security: Data security is improved since the resources are not shared with other users.
-   Compliance: Compliance with regulations and standards is easier since the organization has complete control over the data.

##### Cons:

-   Cost: Private clouds can be expensive to set up and maintain since the organization is responsible for all infrastructure costs.
-   Scalability: Scaling up or down can be a challenge since the organization has to add or remove resources manually.
-   Flexibility: Private clouds may not offer the same level of flexibility as public clouds since they are built for specific needs.

#### Hybrid Cloud: 
A hybrid cloud is a combination of public and private clouds that work together to provide computing resources. Organizations can use the public cloud for non-sensitive workloads and the private cloud for sensitive workloads that require enhanced security.

##### Pros:

-   Flexibility: Organizations can take advantage of the cost savings and scalability of the public cloud while keeping sensitive data on the private cloud.
-   Control: Organizations have control over sensitive data while taking advantage of the public cloud's scalability.
-   Cost: Organizations can save money by using the public cloud for non-sensitive workloads.

##### Cons:

-   Complexity: Managing two different cloud environments can be complex and require specialized expertise.
-   Security: Integrating two different cloud environments can introduce security risks if not properly managed.
-   Dependence: Organizations are still dependent on the public cloud provider for availability and performance.
