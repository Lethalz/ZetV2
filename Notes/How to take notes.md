# How to take notes


##### Flow-Based Method

The flow-based method was developed by Scott H. Young who successfully completed the MIT Challenge. Flow is the mental state of complete engagement. Young calls his method holistic learning. 

With flow-based note taking, your goal isn’t transcription it’s learning while in class. The simplest form of flow-based notes is just to write down all the information, except instead of recording it into a bulleted list, you organize it spatially with arrows connecting ideas. It looks more like a hand drawn mind-map with arrows than anything else.

Three principles used in Flow-Based note taking:

1. **Simplify**.  Write the information in your own words. Use the Feynman Technique.
2. **Visualize**. Use diagrams and images and vocabulary to represent new ideas.
3. **Make Connections.**  Connect ideas backwards, between topics, and externally with what you already know. 

Best Use: The best use could be in a review lecture. Presumably, you already know the material. You can engage your creative (right) brain by drawing the flow-based notes and begin to make connections that lead to learning.
