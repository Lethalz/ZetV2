# How to create time with a full time job

1 Audit your time 

[mandatory hours] - 168 (hours in the week)
eating 
sleeping 
work 
commuting 


2: clarify objectives
CCNP 
working out
Teachnical reading

3: cut noise (identify essential cut negatives)
audit again but this time  put a plus on positives and a minus on negatives 
focus on optimizing

identify how to move the needle forward


3 Structure your day

Priority, difficulty , energy 
start the say with high difficulty tasks
find energy peaks

4 Use weekends to build the life you want not escape the life you have
these are another day of work but you are working for yourself

5 Make your job work for you not against you  
enjoy the process , the job makes you a better person think about the job you did with jay. It taught you people skills
