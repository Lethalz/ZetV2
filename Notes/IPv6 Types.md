# IPv6 Types

# Global Unicast
A global unicast IPv6 address is a type of IPv6 address used for communication on the global Internet. It is unique across the entire Internet and is used to identify individual devices or interfaces on IPv6-enabled networks worldwide. Global unicast IPv6 addresses are similar in function to public IPv4 addresses in the IPv4 addressing scheme.

Key characteristics of global unicast IPv6 addresses include:

1. **Global Reachability**: Global unicast addresses are routable on the public Internet, allowing devices to communicate with each other across different networks and geographical locations.
    
2. **Global Uniqueness**: Each global unicast IPv6 address must be globally unique. This uniqueness is achieved through a combination of the device's MAC (Media Access Control) address and the network prefix, as well as some additional bits for addressing hierarchy.
    
3. **Prefix Assignment**: Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and regional Internet registries (RIRs) are responsible for assigning global IPv6 address prefixes to organizations and entities, ensuring that address allocation is coordinated to prevent conflicts.
    
4. **Public and Private Address Ranges**: Like IPv4, IPv6 also has address ranges designated for private use within organizations (similar to RFC 1918 addresses in IPv4). However, global unicast addresses are used for public Internet communication.
    
5. **128-Bit Address Format**: IPv6 addresses are 128 bits in length, significantly larger than IPv4 addresses (32 bits). This extended address space allows for an almost infinite number of unique global unicast addresses, accommodating the growing number of devices connected to the Internet.
