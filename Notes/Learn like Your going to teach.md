# Learn like Your going to teach

I love teaching others, use this to your advantage. 

When learning any subject or reading books , read them as though you were going to teach a class on that subject the next day. 

When reading a book, If you arent sure about some vocab 'look it up' your students will be curious as well

if you see something pertaining to teh main topic that will help you teach the subject then make note of that.

if theres something that you disagree with or something you dont udnerstand in that moment make note of it
