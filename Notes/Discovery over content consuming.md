# Discovery over content consuming



Be curious

Dive deeper

Engage like a scientist 

Just start
	when we have a gap in knowledge for something we want to do our brain sends out the same hormones that mimic pain

Find the knowledge you need to start
	AI is better than ever 


Work with others that are working towards the same goals 
	I noticed this the other day while i was in my discord chat, I wanted to speak about ai and other tech stuff 
	but no one seems interested I need to find people that are interested in the same thing

Attend conferences and meetups
