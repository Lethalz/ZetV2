# Mutual Funds and ETF

## Mutual Funds 
Passive money management
Pool your money to have it managed for you
No proof that it works 
Should be consistently beating the return of the market, which is kind've impossible
Better  to just put your money in the S&P 500

## ETF
*Exchange Traded Funds* or an index fund tracks an underlying market
Broad Market ownership
Better than mutual funds
Index fund > mutual fund

Inverse ETF is betting that the asset goes down in value. (bear investor)
