# The push and pull of life


Life is a series of force and letting go. 

Just like in a game of tug-of-war you need to know when to go with the flow and relieve some constraint and right when they think to have you, pull.


This ying and yang balance is a constant journey.

Live and let go but learn to seize the opportunities.
