# Active listening

Listening is a skill you have to practice just like anything else, and at first it will be hard and awkward because as humans we are not made to be listeners.

As humans we have a multitude of biases that affect our daily decisions. These biases affect the way we listen. Biases are not inherently bad, without them life would be significantly harder. 

In order to remove your biases from a conversation, you should theoretically remove 'yourself' from the conversation and think of your role in the convo as a mediator. 

As a mediator you get to see anything from both sides, instead of answering to respond your listening to understand the other party's point.


To understand the other party's point even better you start with wide over-arching questions as you get closer to your answer you narrow down your questions in specificity.

Sometimes people will not want to tell you pivotal information but as a mediator you shouldnt get frustrated but curious. 
Curiosity helps you gain an understanding of the person or subject more quickly because you become genuinely interested.

Learn to read non-verbal behaviors, we learned alot of non verbal behaviors in the book [[What everyBody is saying]]
