# 3 stock trading mindset lessons

 **Mr. Market** (think about him like an unpredictable maniac depressive) 
 - People have been trying to figure out the stock market since the very beginning 
	 Looking for patterns and little trends they can use to make money 
 - But the truth is, that no has done successfully for an extended period of time 
 - that’s why a lot of great investors think about the market like **chapter 8** of the intelligent investor : **Most of the time the market is right in its valuation of a companies, that’s what happens when millions of people are buying and selling stocks** 
 Sometimes the stock overvalues a stock, and sometimes it undervalues a stock, So that’s why you must think for yourself In the short term.
  The stock market is a Voting machine (opinion based), but in the Long term it's weighting machine (the value catches up to the stock) 

**Margin of Safety** –  You see like the example above, if you know something is worth 400-500Million dollars And you buy it for the price of $100M, when you're buying a company you are buying the entire business. That means you have a massive margin of safety just in case you are wrong.
	  However a lot of people do the opposite (they assume a good business will always be a good investment but at a certain price anything can be a terrible investment, even a good business)
