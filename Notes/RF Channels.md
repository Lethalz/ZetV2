What is a wifi channel?

a wifi channel number is actually a collection of different frequencies working together

i.e channel 1 in the 2.4 ghx space cosnidts of all frequiences from 2.401 ghz thorugh 2.423 ghz
all fo these frequecicnaes can be modulated difeerenft at the same tiem to encode data 


within each band a signle wifi channcel can come : 20MHz of band width 802.11B

A WIFI CHANNEL NUMEBR IS ALLOCATED AT THE CENTERPOINTOF EACH 22MHZ BANDWIDTH SPREAD



PLANNING FOR Rf CHANNEL implementation


Channels must be selected that dont overlap
YOU WANT TO USE 1, 6, 11
