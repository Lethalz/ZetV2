# Radio Frequency Propagation

## Introduction
RF signals experience various phenomena during propagation from transmitter to receiver. These effects can degrade, block, or alter the signal path.

## Signal Interference Types

### 1. Absorption
- Materials absorb RF energy, either partially or completely
- Common absorbing materials:
  - Rock and stone
  - Water
  - Drywall
  - Human body

#### Material Absorption Rates
| Material | 2.4 GHz Loss (dB) | 5 GHz Loss (dB) |
|----------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Drywall | 3-4 | 4-5 |
| Wood Door | 3-4 | 6-7 |
| Glass Window | 2-3 | 6-8 |
| Metal Door | 13-19 | 25-32 |
| Concrete Wall | 6-8 | 10-12 |
| Brick Wall | 4-6 | 8-10 |
| Human Body | 3-6 | 6-8 |
| Water | 5-7 | 7-9 |

### 2. Reflection
- Signal bounces off materials
- No energy absorption
- Common reflective surfaces:
  - Metal surfaces
  - Bodies of water

### 3. Refraction
- Signal bends when passing through different densities
- Examples: air to glass transition
- Different materials have unique refractive indexes
- Changes signal direction after passing through

### 4. Diffraction
- Signals bend and spread around obstacles
- Common causes:
  - Hills
  - Buildings
- Creates RF shadows
- Results in:
  - Dead coverage zones
  - Degraded signal strength

### 5. Scattering
- Similar to refraction but larger scale
- Unpredictable signal degradation
- Caused by:
  - Smog
  - Dust
  - Tree foliage
  - Humidity

## Signal Loss Factors

### Free Space Path Loss
- Natural RF energy loss through air
- Calculable loss
- Factors affecting loss:
  - Frequency
  - Distance

### Multipath
- Multiple copies of original signal
- Caused by signal expansion and object interaction
- Major contributor: metal surfaces

#### Multipath Effects
- Data corruption
- Signal nulling
- Amplitude variations:
  - Increased signal strength
  - Decreased signal strength

#### Mitigation
- Multiple antenna implementation
- MIMO technology
- Diversity reception

## Best Practices
- Consider environmental factors in RF planning
- Account for building materials
- Use multiple antennas where possible
- Plan for seasonal changes (foliage)
