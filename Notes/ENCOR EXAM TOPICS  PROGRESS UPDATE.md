# Explain the working principles of the Cisco SD-WAN solution

Cisco SD-WAN is divided into control and data planes

Control plane:

Cisco DNA Center: Acts as the centralized controller.

LISP (Location/ID Seperation Protocol) Mapping system:Manages endpoint-to-location mappings, allowing devices to move within the network without impacting their network identity.

Policy Plane (Cisco ISE) Manages user and device identities, enforcing security policies and network access

vSmart Controllers(cloud): Centralized controllers that manage policies, route distribution. Facilitate communication between vEdge routers

vBond Orchestrator(cloud): Handles initial authentication and auth of WAN edge devices

vManage(cloud):Centralized management dashboard for monitoring/config/troubleshoot. Provides overview.

Data plane:

Fabric Edge Nodes: Switches at the network edge that provide user and device connectivity, they are responsible for encapsulation traffic into VXLAN (Virtual Extensible LAN) to traverse the fabric

vEdge Routers(hardware/virtual): Physical or virtual devices deployed at the edge of the network in offices/data centers/cloud environments

C-Edge router(hardware/virtual): High performance, represent the next generation of Edge devices, improved performance, scalability and better integration with Cisco SD-Wan features

Benefits and limitations of SD-WAN solutions

+cost efficiency, lower WAN costs, because MPLS circuits as an alternative is expensive.

+reduced complexity

+Better performance, prioritizes critical applications and optimizes traffic

+rapid deployment & scalability

+central management

+enhanced security/built in security IPsec tunnels etc.

-difficult to integrate with legacy systems

-may require adjustment with existing network

-latency compared to MPLS

-bandwidth less predictable than MPLS

-higher upfront costs for equipment and licensing

-ongoing subscription fees

Cisco SD-Wan Solution: Working Principles

Cisco's SD-WAN solution is designed to optimize and secure wide-area network (WAN) connectivity by leveraging software-defined networking (SDN) principles.

-Centralised Management: vManage allows admins to configure/manage/monitor entire WAN

-Policy-Based Control: Centrally defined policies

-Application-aware Routing: Traffic routed based on specific application requirements, improves performance

-Secure Connectivity: Built in security features such as IPsec VPN, firewall, threat detection

-Transport independence: Supports multiple types of WAN connections including MPLS, broadband, LTE, satellite

-Dynamic Path selection: automatically selects the best path for traffic

# Interpret wired and wireless QoS configurations

QoS Components

Classification

Identification: Categorizes traffic based on attributes like IP address, application type, or protocol.

Marking

Tags: Marks packets with QoS labels (e.g DSCP or CoS) to indicate priority

-Differentiated Services Code Point-is used to classify and manage network traffic to provide different levels of service based on packet priority and type.

Class of service-used to provide QoS at Layer 2 (Data Link Layer) of the OSI model, typically in Ethernet frames.

Queuing:

Buffers: Organises packets into queues based on priority, managing congestion and ensuring high -priority traffic is serviced first

Policing and Shaping:

Policing: Enforces traffic limits and drops packets that exceed the defined rate

Shaping: Controls the rate of outgoing traffic to smooth out bursts and ensure delivery

Wired QoS Policies:

Class maps: Define traffic classes based on match criteria

Policy Maps: Apply QoS actions to traffic classes (eg priority queuing, bandwidth allocation)

Service Policies: Attach policy maps to interfaces to enforce QoS rules

Wireless QoS Policies:

WMM (Wifi Multimedia) Provides Qos for wireless traffic by categorizing into voice/video/best-effort and background classes

AP QoS Settings: Configures access points to prioritize traffic based on WMM or custom QoS policies.

# Describe Hardware and Software Switching Mechanisms

Cisco Express Forwarding(CEF):

-a more advanced and efficient packet-forward method. CEF improves performance by using a pre-built forward table which doesn’t rely on CPU.

Uses both:  FIB - (Forwarding Information base) used for fast lookups of forwarding decisions

                    Adjacency Table - Contains layer 2 information of next hop devices

-Use case: Standard in most modern high-performance routers and switches

TCAM - (Ternary Content Addressable Memory)

-special type of hardware memory used to store the mac-address table, to enable high speed lookups

0, 1 , and don’t care

FIB- (Forward information Base)- (show cef) Stored in the TCAM, stores the best routes that the switch will use

RIB- (Routing information Base) (show ip route)- Stored in RAM and holds all the routing information and routing protocols data

Summary:

Process switching is CPU-intensive whilst CEF is hardware-based and much faster.

MAC Address Table vs. TCAM: The MAC Address Table is used for Layer 2 forwarding based on MAC addresses, while TCAM is used for high-speed lookups in Layer 3 forwarding and complex policies.

FIB vs. RIB: The FIB is used for quick packet forwarding decisions and is built from the RIB, which stores detailed routing information used for building the FIB.

# Describe network virtualization concepts

LISP (Location/ID Separation Protocol) is a protocol designed to address the scalability challenges associated with IP address mobility and routing. LISP separates the concept of an endpoint identifier from its location, providing more flexibility and scalability.

Key Concepts of LISP:

-  Identifiers (EIDs - Endpoint Identifiers): Represent the identity of a device or endpoint. These are used to identify the source and destination of packets.

-  Locators (RLOCs - Routing Locators): Represent the location of a device in the network. RLOCs are used to route packets to the correct destination.

LISP Architecture:

EID-to-RLOC Mapping: Maintained by a distributed mapping system. This mapping helps in translating EIDs to RLOCs

Ingress LISP Router: Encapsulates packets with LISP headers and sends them to the Egress LISP Router.

Egress LISP Router: Decapsulates LISP headers and forwards packets to the final destination based on the EID.

LISP Components:

MAP-Server: Maintains and distributes the EID-to-RLOC mappings.

MAP-Resolver: Resolves the EID to an RLOC by querying the Map-server

Benefits of LISP:

Scalability: Reduces the size of the global routing table by separating endpoint identity from location.

Mobility: Facilitates endpoint mobility by allowing endpoints to move without changing their identity.

Multihoming: Simplifies multihoming by managing multiple connections with different ISPs.

VXLAN (Virtual Extensible LAN) is a network virtualization technology that encapsulates Layer 2 Ethernet frames within Layer 3 UDP packets. It extends Layer 2 networks across Layer 3 boundaries, allowing for scalable and flexible network architectures.

Key Concepts of VXLAN:

Encapsulation

VXLAN Header: Encapsulates Ethernet frames within UDP packets. This VXLAN header includes a VXLAN Network Identifier (VNI), which identifies the VXLAN segment.

UDP Encapsulation: The VXLAN-encapsulated frames are carried over UDP, allowing them to traverse Layer 3 networks.

VXLAN Architecture:

VXLAN Tunnel Endpoints (VTEPs): Devices that perform the encapsulation and decapsulation of VXLAN frames. VTEPs are typically implemented on switches or routers.

VTEP Functions:

Ingress VTEP: Encapsulates outgoing Layer 2 frames into VXLAN packets.

Egress VTEP: Decapsulates incoming VXLAN packets back into Layer 2 frames.

VXLAN Components:

VXLAN Network Identifier (VNI): A 24-bit field used to identify different VXLAN segments. This allows for up to 16 million VXLAN segments.

Multicast or Unicast: VXLAN can use multicast, unicast, or a combination of both for VXLAN packet distribution across the network.

Layer 3:

Compare routing concepts of EIGRP and OSPF

EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol):

- Type: Advanced Distance Vector (Hybrid).
- Metrics: Measures routes using a composite metric based on bandwidth, delay, load, and reliability.
- Load Balancing: Supports both equal-cost load balancing (by default) and unequal-cost load balancing (using Variance to handle paths with different costs).
- Convergence: Generally faster convergence due to incremental updates and the Diffusing Update Algorithm (DUAL), which provides loop-free path calculations.
- Operation: Maintains a topology table for storing route information and uses this for efficient route computation and selection.

OSPF (Open Shortest Path First):

- Type: Link-State.
- Metrics: Measures routes using a single metric called cost, which is based on the bandwidth of the links (default cost formula: 10^8 / bandwidth in bps). Lower cost values represent preferred paths.
- Load Balancing: Supports equal-cost load balancing only, across multiple paths with the same cost.
- Convergence: Typically slower convergence compared to EIGRP due to the need to recalculate the Shortest Path First (SPF) tree based on the Link-State Database (LSDB) after receiving Link-State Advertisements (LSAs).
- Operation: Maintains a Link-State Database that contains a complete map of the network topology, used to compute the SPF tree for routing decisions.

show ip bgp summary show ip bgp neighbors

Verify eBGP Best Path Selection:

 show ip bgp show ip bgp bestpath

Check eBGP Neighbor Relationships:

show ip bgp neighbors 192.168.2.1

Describe policy-based routing

Allows routing decisions based on criteria other than destination IP, such as source IP, protocol, or application.

How It Works:

First you define an access list:

Router(config)# access-list 100 permit ip 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 any

Then create the Route Map:

Router(config)# route-map PBR-MAP permit 10

Router(config-route-map)# match ip address 100

Router(config-route-map)# set ip next-hop 10.1.1.1

Apply to the interface:

Router(config)# interface GigabitEthernet0/1

Router(config-if)# ip policy route-map PBR-MAP

Key Points:

- Access List: Defines which packets the policy will apply to.
- Route Map: Specifies what action to take on the matched packets.
- Interface Application: Applies the policy to traffic passing through the interface.

Wireless

Dipole Antenna: Provides basic, general coverage, typically used on consumer-grade APs.

### Access Point Discovery and Join Process

1. Discovery:

- Initial Scan: APs scan channels to find nearby WirelessLanControllers (WLC’s).
- Discovery Methods:

- Broadcast: APs send broadcast packets to find WLCs. 255.255.255.255
- Multicast: APs use multicast to locate WLCs. 224.0.0.251 (used for Service Discovery Protocol (SDP) FF02::C (used for CAPWAP discovery)
- Direct Query: APs query known IPs or DNS names.
- DHCP Option 43: APs obtain WLC info from a DHCP server.

2. Join:

- WLC Selection: APs select a WLC based on response quality and criteria.
- Join Request: APs send a join request with their details to the chosen WLC.
- WLC Response: WLC provides configuration and management settings.
- Configuration: APs configure themselves as per WLC instructions and start operating.

This process ensures APs find and connect to the appropriate WLC efficiently.

### Layer 2 Roaming

- Principle: Moves between APs within the same subnet; IP address remains the same.
- Use Cases:

- High mobility environments (e.g., large offices).
- VoIP and video calls needing seamless handoff.
- Consistent user experience within a single network segment.

### Layer 3 Roaming

- Principle: Moves between APs in different subnets; requires a new IP address.
- Use Cases:

- Large networks with multiple subnets.
- Networks with different VLANs or security segments.
- Scenarios needing network segmentation and organization

Troubleshoot WLAN configuration and wireless client connectivity issues using GUI only

Describe wireless segmentation with groups, profiles, and tags

Wireless Segmentation Components

Groups: Manage and apply policies to sets of APs or users.

Profiles: Define detailed settings for each group or segment. (Configurations for APs and SSIDs.Define behavior, security, and QoS settings.) such as profiles for employee access, guest access, or IoT devices.

Tags: Dynamically apply profiles based on labels. Apply policies dynamically based on labels. Tags like "guest" or "employee" apply specific policies.

IP Services

### Network Time Protocol (NTP)

- Purpose: General time synchronization for most networks within milliseconds
- Key Configurations:

- ntp server 192.168.1.1 - defines what NTP server to use
- ntp peer 192.168.1.2 – Sets up two-way synchronization with 192.168.1.2.
- Stratum: stratum 2 – refers to the number of stratums away from the reference clock
- ntp update-calendar command on a Cisco device is used to synchronize the system clock with the NTP server and update the hardware clock
- Authentication: keys 1 – ntp authentication-key 1 md5 your_password_here, ntp trusted-key 1
- show ntp associations - Lists the NTP servers the device is associated with, including their stratum levels.

Mechanism: Relies on software-based timestamping and statistical algorithms to estimate and correct for network delays, which introduces more variability and less precision

### Precision Time Protocol (PTP)

- Purpose: Provides high-precision time synchronization, within nanoseconds.
- Key Configurations:

- Grandmaster: ptp master – Configures the device as the PTP master clock.
- Slave: ptp slave – Configures the device to synchronize with a master clock.
- Domain: domain 0 – Groups devices into PTP domain 0.
- Sync Interval: sync_interval 1 – Sets synchronization messages to be sent every second.
- Delay Mechanism: delay_mechanism peer-to-peer – Uses peer-to-peer delay measurement.

Mechanism: Uses hardware timestamping and specialized protocols to measure and compensate for network delays more precisely.

Describe multicast protocols, such as RPF check, PIM and IGMP v2/v3

1. RPF Check (Reverse Path Forwarding Check)

        Purpose: Ensures multicast packets are received on the correct interface.

        How: Verifies that the packet arrives on the interface used to reach the source, preventing loops.

2. PIM (Protocol Independent Multicast)

        PIM Sparse Mode (PIM-SM): Uses a Rendezvous Point (RP) to manage multicast traffic for sparse networks.

        PIM Dense Mode (PIM-DM): Floods multicast traffic to all interfaces initially and prunes non-receiving interfaces.

        PIM Bi-directional Mode: Allows traffic to flow in both directions between sources and receivers.

3. IGMP (Internet Group Management Protocol)

        IGMP v2: Hosts join/leave multicast groups and routers query membership.

        IGMP v3: Adds source-specific multicast (SSM), allowing hosts to specify which sources they want to receive from.

Summary

        RPF Check: Validates the correct interface for multicast packets.

        PIM: Manages multicast traffic distribution (Sparse, Dense, Bi-directional).

        IGMP: Manages group membership (v2 basic, v3 with source-specific multicast).

# Automation

To interpret basic Python components and scripts, understand these fundamental elements:

### Variables - Store data values.

Example: x = 10 (assigns the value 10 to the variable x).

### Data Types - int (integer), float (decimal), str (string), list (collection), dict (dictionary), tuple (immutable collection), set (unique collection).

- Example: name = "Alice" (string), numbers = [1, 2, 3] (list).

### Operators

- Arithmetic: +, -, *, /, % (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus).
- Comparison: ==, !=, >, <, >=, <= (equality, inequality, greater than, less than, etc.).
- Logical: and, or, not (logical conjunction, disjunction, negation).

### Control Structures - Execute code based on conditions.

if x > 10:

        print("x is greater than 10")

else:

        print("x is 10 or less")

Loops: Repeat code execution.

for i in range(5):

        print(i)

While Loop:

count = 0

while count < 5:

        print(count)

        count += 1

### Functions - Reusable code blocks.

### def greet(name):

        return f"Hello, {name}!"

Usage: greeting = greet("Alice")

### Classes and Objects

- Class: Blueprint for creating objects.
- Object: Instance of a class.

Example:

class Person:

        def __init__(self, name):

            self.name = name

        def say_hello(self):

            return f"Hello, my name is {self.name}"

person = Person("Alice")

print(person.say_hello())

### Importing Modules

- Purpose: Reuse code from other files or libraries.

import math

print(math.sqrt(16))

### File Handling

- Reading files

with open('file.txt', 'r') as file:

        content = file.read()

        print(content)

- Writing files

with open('file.txt', 'w') as file:

        file.write("Hello, World!")

Construct valid JSON-encoded files

Basic Structure: JSON uses objects {}, arrays [], strings, numbers, booleans, and null.

Key-Value Pairs:

- Keys are strings in double quotes.
- Values can be strings, numbers, objects, arrays, true, false, or null.

Syntax Rules:

- Strings are in double quotes.
- No trailing commas.
- Use a JSON validator for correctness.

Examples:

Object:

{

        "name": "Alice",

        "age": 30,

        "active": true,

        "courses": ["Math", "Science"]

}

Array:

["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

Nested JSON:

{

        "user": {

            "id": 1,

            "name": "Alice",

            "address": {

                "street": "456 Elm St",

                "city": "Wonderland"

            }

        }

}

Saving: Save JSON data in a file with a .json extension, e.g., data.json.

Compare agent vs. agentless orchestration tools, such as Chef, Puppet, Ansible, and SaltStack

Agent-Based Tools:

- Chef: Requires agents on target machines. Agents communicate with a central server for configuration. Provides centralized control and robust features but adds overhead due to agent management.
- Puppet: Uses agents that periodically check in with a central server. Offers strong reporting and complex management but requires agent installation.
- SaltStack (Agent-Based Mode): Utilizes agents (minions) to communicate with a central master. Provides high-speed communication and scalability but necessitates agent installation.

Agentless Tools:

- Ansible: Operates without agents by using SSH or WinRM to connect directly with nodes. Simplifies setup and management but may be slower for large environments due to SSH overhead.
- SaltStack (Agentless Mode): Can work without agents using SSH. Offers flexibility but is generally less efficient than its agent-based mode.

In summary, agent-based tools offer comprehensive features and centralized management but require agents, whereas agentless tools are simpler and do not need agents but may have performance limitations.
