# 3 Rules of Note-Making

Refine don't rush

Cultivate dont collect

write dont recite



Refine dont rush

 Don't look to write as fast as possible
 
 Sit down and think deeply about what you are writing
 
 Go back as many times as you need to "refine" the notes you create
 
 
 
 Cultivate dont collect

 Rather than passively gather information actively develop and grow your 
 notes like your ideas.

Wouldnt you rather connect your notes and have the information you store be living and breathing rather than highlights on a page

Creating and transforming this information raises your level of understanding. 


Write don't recite

A lot of times I find myself being a typewriter to information i recieve but if you aren't parsing the infopamotion you recieve for imporantance you arent learning you are just reciting.

Focus on your own understanding, and write things in your own words. Even the slightest changes cause an increase in retention.
