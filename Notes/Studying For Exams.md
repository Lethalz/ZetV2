# Studying For Exams

Do not try and read through whole certification guides and books at once.

From personal expeirence, I love reading books but the cert guides are really 'dry' and not meant ot be read through.

Go through each section(part) for example STP would be one, then VLans, IPs, etc..
And understand it fully.
