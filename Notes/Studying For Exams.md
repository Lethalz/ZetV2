# Studying For Exams

Do not try and read through whole certification guides and books at once.

From personal expeirence, I love reading books but the cert guides are really 'dry' and not meant ot be read through.

Go through each section(part) for example STP would be one, then VLans, IPs, etc..
And understand it fully.

# For CCNA

1.  Read the chapter. /watch the section
    
2.  Do the end of chapter review questions/labs.
    
3.  Lab what was learned in that chapter (GNS3 mainly, some Packet Tracer).
    
4.  Go back through the chapter again, taking notes in OneNote and Googling anything that needed further explanation/understanding (paying special attention to the things I felt I was weak on - the end of the chapter reviews help to identify this).
    
5.  Go through my notes and make Anki flashcards.
    
6.  Proceed to the next chapter only after completing all of these steps.
