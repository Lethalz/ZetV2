## What is deep learning?

> “Deep learning is a machine learning technique that teaches computers to do what comes naturally to humans_”_

Deep learning is a series of algorithms that attempts to imitate the learning of a human brain, or at least that’s what they claim, what actually happens inside is that it performs several complex mathematical functions that make it possible for a computer to perform a task like humans.

For example, we have seen driverless cars well deep learning is the key technology behind this miracle, we can talk to our phone and issue a command and it will do said task, eg Siri, Amazon Alexa, well deep learning makes all of this possible.

Through deep learning, a computer model learns to perform classification tasks directly from images, text, or audio. Deep learning algorithms can achieve state-of-the-art accuracy, even exceeding human-level performance from time to time.

## Why learn Deep Learning?

**State of the art performance**: Speech recognition, Object detection, and image classification are some of the problems where traditional machine learning algorithms fails., but deep learning algorithm such as CNN, and RNNs performs exceptionally well due to their architectures.

**Scales with data**: As the data increases the classical machine learning algorithms’ performance plateaus, but deep learning algorithms’ performance increases as we add more data.

**Less Feature Engineering:** Classical machine learning algorithms often require complex feature engineering, after a deeper analysis of the dataset which makes it unappealing to most newbies that want to get their hands on machine learning, however, in deep learning, there is little to no feature and can learn from the data directly.

**Transferable:** One of the major advantages of deep learning is that we don’t really need to build everything from scratch, models trained for one problem can be used for other but related tasks, for example, in the computer vision domain, pre-trained image classification networks such as VGG16, ResNets, MobileNet, are often used as a feature extraction front-end for object detection and segmentation problems. The use of these pre-trained networks eases the model’s training and often helps achieve higher performance in a shorter period of time. This can be useful when we don’t exactly have a huge dataset and the computing resources are also limited.

## How To Get Started With Deep Learning?

Getting started with deep learning can seem intimidating at first, with all the suggestions and advice floating around the internet, but it doesn’t have to be that way, we know starting with deep learning can be a headache when you don’t have an exact roadmap.

That’s the reason we have prepared a complete list of topics, and books as a beginner’s guide to learn deep learning.

## 1. Learn Python

You always need a language whenever you have to implement any logic or write any program. For that, python is the go-to language of most deep learning and machine learning practitioners because of its simplicity. It is a great choice as the first language to learn and there is no denying that it is extremely popular.

There are many machine learning frameworks like Tensorflow, Pytorch, Caffe, Theano, Keras, etc, Python makes your life easy when you are implementing complex deep learning algorithms like CNN and RNN.

Here is the book that you can refer to learn the basics of python.

## Book1: Head First Python: A Beginner-friendly guide

**Author:** _Paul Barry_

**Best For** _Beginners_

This book will talk to you literally, one thing that separates this book from the rest is that it provides more of a visual format to engage our brain rather than using a syntax savvy approach that can become boring pretty fast.

## 2. Mathematics

Deep learning requires maths and lots of maths, but one need not be an expert in maths to delve into the realm of deep learning. If you have studied mathematics in your college you can start learning right now. Pretty much every course and tutorial that you find on the internet will require you to have a basic understanding of linear algebra and calculus, Here is are some of the books that I think are really helpful.

**Book 1: Math for Deep Learning: What You Need to Know to Understand Neural Networks**

**Author:** _Ronald T. Kneusel_

**Best For** _Intermediate_

if you need a little refresher you can refer to this book. The book expects you to have high school-level mathematical proficiency, it provides a sufficient mathematical foundation to get you started with deep learning.
