# Law of effection Example


When "Ochocinco" was on Club SHay Shay 

He pointed out that once his name rang bells money had no use.

This shows magnitude,  his name carried weight therefore no money in the world would prove his value more than his "name"

Now If he used that name to make a "sneaker" or someting of the sort now we're talking about scale + Magnitude = Billionaire 

Although his name would need to carry that weight the whole time. I.e micheal Jordan.
