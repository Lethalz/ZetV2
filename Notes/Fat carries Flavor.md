# Fat carries Flavor

Fat coats the tongue, allowing various aromatic compounds to stay in contact with our taste buds for longer periods of time. Intensifying and prolonging our experience of various flavors. 
This is why things seem to taste better with an oil base than a water base, the fat is a medium for the flavors to travel, and they last longer.
