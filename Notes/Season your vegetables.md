# Season your vegetables
There are 4 main methods
Salt them 
dress them
pickle them
roast them

Seasonings are essentialÂ **to bring out the flavour of your vegetables**. Salt is the bare minimum, and the right amount will make a huge difference. Add salt gradually and taste as you go, they should taste more flavourful but not outright salty.
