# WiFi Modulation Techniques

## Understanding Modulation
- Radio frequency is electromagnetic radiation
- Data encoding achieved by changing RF properties
- Process of changing these properties = modulation

## Modulation Properties

### 1. Frequency
- Higher frequency enables more data encoding
- Frequency Modulation (FM):
  - Involves modifying signal frequency to encode data
  - Measured in millions or billions of Hertz
- Used for digital signal encoding

### 2. Wavelength
- Measured in meters
- Relationship with frequency:
  - Inversely proportional
  - Higher frequency = shorter wavelength
  - Lower frequency = longer wavelength
- Key characteristics:
  - Distance between wave peaks
  - Longer wavelengths penetrate materials better
  - Better signal propagation with longer wavelengths

### 3. Amplitude
- Measures signal strength/power
- Can be modulated to encode data
- Key considerations:
  - Weakens significantly over distance
  - Degrades when passing through objects (attenuation)
  - Power level affects transmission range

### 4. Phase
- Comparative measurement between RF signals
- Characteristics:
  - 100% in phase = identical waveforms at comparison point
  - Phase can be internally modified for data encoding
  - Used in modern WiFi standards

     Amplitude
         ↕
    ┌─────────┐
    │         │         Wavelength
    │         │         ←───────→
────┘         └─────────────────────
         Phase angle
           ←─→
```

## Key Relationships
- Frequency and Wavelength are inversely related
- Amplitude affects transmission distance
- Phase relationships enable advanced modulation schemes
