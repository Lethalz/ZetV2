# Better Homecooking
Home cooking has very little in common with cooking professionally but I can offer some guidance that will help home cooks with the fundamentals:

-   Learn the underlying principles of the science of food- Harold McGee's [On Food & Cooking](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/101255.On_Food_and_Cooking) is the OG book that came long before SFAH and the like. This is the one book that is on the shelf of every chef I know. If you're into video and lectures, Harvard's [food science lecture series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9av8-lhJS8&ab_channel=HarvardUniversity) is on Youtube for free.
    
-   Learn proper technique- Jacques Pépin's [New Complete Techniques](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14357461-jacques-p-pin-new-complete-techniques?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=6AwpEKfq1Z&rank=1) is a great starting point. His old KQED/PBS shows are fantastic and available on Youtube. For the advanced version, CIA's [The Professional Chef](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/306235.The_Professional_Chef?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=75mJAb5eUZ&rank=1) will broaden horizons when it comes to product identification, breaking down proteins, etc.
    
-   Start to develop intuitive cooking by eating a variety of cuisines and learning what goes with what. When culinary students ask me how to develop a better palate my advice is simply _just eat._ [The Flavour Bible](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4443485-the-flavor-bible) is also a good resource.
    
-   Up your plating game by understanding [plating concepts](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/kn3drw/how_did_you_learn_to_plate_food/ghi3gtu/) of colour, contrast, construction, and composition.
    
-   [Here's everything they don't teach you in culinary school](https://old.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/jquti8/what_skills_are_being_taught_at_culinary_school/gbpi5qx/) but gets whacked into your brain when working in a fast paced kitchen.
    
-   Get a good freaking knife and learn how to take care of it. [r/chefknives](https://www.reddit.com/r/chefknives/) has a great wiki and [getting started guide.](https://www.reddit.com/r/chefknives/wiki/gettingstarted) Good knife skills will make cooking go 90% faster. Nothing pains me more than watching by little brother the Genius Engineer take five minutes to cut an onion that would take me 30 seconds. He also lets trash pandas eat out of the cat bowls in his house so maybe this is a broader issue than I will admit to at this time.
    
-   And I cannot emphasise enough the following two things: mise en place and clean as you go. Organising your work environment is the key to being efficient with your labour and time in a kitchen. For example, when I am prepping, I have three bowls- 1] for uprepped product, 2] for scrap, 3] for finished prep. Think ahead, combine steps where you can. Clean as you go means get rid of scrap, re-use that bowl, wipe down, organise used tools, don't be a disaster child who has seventeen dirty spoons and flour everywhere once you put something in the oven and crack open a beer.
    
-   Use recipes from known sources to improve your cooking. The biggest mistake I see around here is people using random untested recipes from dubious sources and food bloggers who aren't trained chefs and then wondering why a dish came out fucked up. Tasty, I am looking at you in particular.
    
-   Ask a chef at what temp and how long and the answer will be "cook it til its done." Understanding the underlying principles of why some things are cooked at high heat quickly vs. low and slow will open up a whole new world. Understanding the visual and even aural clues of cooking are key. Learn to see when oil is just hot enough to lay a piece of fish skin side down and it won't stick. Pâte à choux has enough eggs added in when it _slaps_ just so in the mixer.
    

Hope this wall of text helps.
