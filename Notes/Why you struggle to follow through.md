# Why You Struggle to Follow Through

I happened to come across a video by **HealthyGamerGG**. The premise was, *"Why do some people stick with their curiosities while others fall by the wayside?"*

He alludes that there are four steps that move **anyone** from *thinking* to *doing*:

## 1. **Curiosity: The Starting Point**

Curiosity is the catalyst to start something new that we find interesting. With that curiosity comes extrinsic information.

When we’re curious, we load up on all this extrinsic information because we’re excited to learn about something new and interesting. 

This is the point where most people stop.

But why?..

Our minds are very active, and we need a host of stimuli to keep us interested in any given moment. Hence, our curiosity—or more succinctly, our *extrinsic* curiosity—has a finite value.

This causes a shift in our focus, sparking curiosity in another subject, field, or hobby.

As long as we stay in the first phase of discovery, we’ll never actually get to doing.

*I’ve personally experienced this with gaming. Along comes the new shiny game, everyone gets excited, we play for a while, get bored, and then move on to the next game.*

## 2. **Theory Crafting: Deepening Engagement**

HealthyGamerGG suggests that the next step is theory crafting.

With this step, we move to a different level of curiosity or engagement with the subject. I’ve always suspected that this was the case, although within gaming, I was never invested enough to get into "theory crafting."

Theory crafting is defined as *"asking questions intrinsically about the subject without extrinsic input."*

This creates an internal “battle” of sorts with the subject you’re interested in, leading to a more cemented interest. Once you reach the intrinsic level of curiosity, you become more engaged with the subject personally, allowing you to push deeper into it.

## 3. **Immersion: Sustaining Focus**

This introduces us to the third step in moving from thinking to doing: constant immersion in the subject. This keeps you invested in what you want to do.

*I’ve noticed this with my YouTube habits. I know it’s a bad habit, but sometimes I let the YouTube algorithm tell me what I’m interested in at that moment.*

By doing this, I might be doing myself a disservice in terms of directing my focus. YouTube doesn’t care about what you watch; it just wants you to watch.

So, I’ll be making a substantial effort to direct my focus toward things I want to invest my time in. Right now, this seems like such an obvious statement, but for example, I don’t get guitar videos in my feed anymore, and now I barely pick up the guitar.

## 4. **Feedback: The Critical Final Step**

The final step of doing is feedback. Feedback is of utmost importance; it can save you years of backtracking or wasting time exploring paths that have already been explored.

One of the points he brings up in the video is that while feedback is crucial, the *timing* of feedback dictates its efficiency. Feedback too early can be harmful, while too late leads to wasted potential.

Why does early feedback hurt? Let’s use the example of builds in *Last Epoch*. I’ve always wanted to create a build, but most of the time, I just follow tried-and-true builds that I know work.

There were times when I started a build and got discouraged because I already knew what was possible. The feedback I got negatively affected my experience with the game.

## **Conclusion**

Curiosity is the key to starting anything, but to continue, you must start asking yourself questions about the subject without the help of others to achieve true mastery.

### Recommended Books to Dive Deeper into This Topic:

1. **"Atomic Habits" by James Clear**  
   - Focuses on building good habits and breaking bad ones, with insights on staying consistent in what you start.  
   *"You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems."*  
   - **Explanation:** This quote is particularly relevant because it highlights that success isn’t about sheer motivation or goals. It’s about building the right systems—similar to how the four steps (curiosity, theory crafting, immersion, and feedback) create a system for moving from thinking to doing. To follow through, you need to structure your environment and processes so that your interests don’t fade.

2. **"Deep Work" by Cal Newport**  
   - Explores how focused work and immersion can lead to mastery and meaningful progress in any field.  
   *"Clarity about what matters provides clarity about what does not."*  
   - **Explanation:** This quote ties into the need to direct your focus toward what you truly care about rather than being distracted by the “shiny objects” that pull your curiosity in multiple directions. The idea of immersion as a key step to mastery aligns perfectly with Newport’s concept of focusing deeply on what matters most to you.

3. **"The War of Art" by Steven Pressfield**  
   - Offers insights on overcoming resistance and self-doubt that prevent us from following through on creative and intellectual pursuits.  
   *"The most important thing about art is to work. Nothing else matters except sitting down every day and trying."*  
   - **Explanation:** This quote reinforces the importance of consistency and pushing through resistance. It’s directly relevant to your points about feedback and immersion—success comes from repeatedly engaging with your subject and resisting the urge to be distracted or give up when feedback isn’t favorable.

4. **"The Power of Habit" by Charles Duhigg**  
   - Delves into the science of habits and how to sustain curiosity and action through routine.  
   *"The Golden Rule of Habit Change: You can’t extinguish a bad habit, you can only change it."*  
   - **Explanation:** This quote emphasizes that habits are powerful drivers of behavior. In the context of the four steps, once you’ve moved past curiosity and into theory crafting and immersion, sustaining progress is about establishing habits that reinforce the behavior you want to continue. This insight is crucial when managing distractions or shifting focus.
