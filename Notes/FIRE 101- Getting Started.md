**Blogs:**

There are a bunch of FIRE blogs out there today. There’s even a [blogger net worth tracker](http://directory.rockstarfinance.com/blogger-net-worth-tracker) where almost 500 bloggers publicly share their net worths. The same site, Rockstar Finance, has lists of the [best early retirement blogs](http://rockstarfinance.com/best-early-retirement-blogs/) and many other personal finance blogs that can be sorted by different categories: Best Overall, Saving, Investing, Debt, Early Retirement, Minimalism, Millennial, and Up & Coming.

Here are the ones where I spent most of my time, bookmarked them, subscribed via email, and/or kept coming back to:

- [Early Retirement Extreme](http://earlyretirementextreme.com/) — I’m obviously a big fan (as described above). Check him out. It will be time well spent.
- [Physician on FIRE](https://www.physicianonfire.com/) — His POF portfolio breakdowns and updates are what I’m using to analyze my own portfolio.
- [jlcollinsnh](http://jlcollinsnh.com/) — Amazing post series on stocks.
- [Root of Good](http://rootofgood.com/) — One of the first blogs I found that started everything for me. Retired in 2013 at age 33.
- [Mad Fientist](https://www.madfientist.com/) — Solid content. Has some spreadsheets and other resources worth checking out.
- [The Money Habit](http://www.themoneyhabit.org/) — As I discussed in this teaser post about [millennial retirement](https://www.sloww.co/millennial-retire/), maybe the youngest early retiree at 28 years old with over $2M.
- [Mr. Money Mustache](https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/) — Arguably the most well-known in the FIRE community. His approach is “Early Retirement through Badassity.” I read a few of his posts, but honestly I spent more time on the other blogs in this list. However, I did thoroughly enjoy one of his videos:
