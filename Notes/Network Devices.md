A Computer network is a digital telecommunications network which allows nodes to share resources.
- This can be two or more nodes connected together.

A **client** is a device that accesses a service provided by a server

A **server** provides a service or functions to clients.

- Think of the client as a Patron at a restaurant and think of the server as the waiter.

**Switches** are used to forward traffic between hosts within a LAN
> Cisco uses the Catalyst model for enterprise level networks
- Switches don't provide connectivity over the internet (WAN)

**Routers** route traffic over the WAN 

**Firewalls** permit or denies traffic from the Internet based on configured rules
