# Learning Strategies

Here are some ideas for how you can put the strategies from "Make It Stick" into practice:

1.  **Interleaving**: If you are studying for a test, try *mixing up* the practice of different skills or concepts rather than focusing on one at a time. 
	- For example, if you are studying math, try doing a few problems from each chapter rather than working through one chapter at a time.
	- If you are practicing vocabulary, try mixing up the words you are learning rather than studying them by category or theme.
    
	-  If you are practicing a musical instrument, try alternating between different songs or pieces rather than focusing on just one at a time.
    
	-  If you are practicing a sport, try mixing up the drills or exercises you are doing rather than focusing on just one type of skill.
    
	-  If you are studying a foreign language, try alternating between practicing grammar, vocabulary, and listening comprehension rather than focusing on just one aspect at a time.
    
		Overall, the idea behind interleaving is to mix up the practice of different skills or concepts rather than focusing on just one at a time. This can help you better retain and apply the material, as it requires you to actively engage with the material and make connections between different ideas.
    
2.  **Retrieval practice**: (Active Recall) Test yourself on the material you are trying to learn by creating your own practice quizzes or asking a friend to quiz you. You can also try using flashcards or other study aids that require you to recall the material from memory.
    
3.  **Spacing:** Plan out your study sessions over time, rather than trying to cram all your studying into a single session. This could involve breaking up your study sessions into shorter, more frequent chunks or scheduling them over several days or weeks.
    
4.  **Elaboration**: As you study, try to explain the material in your own words or create examples to help you better understand and remember it. You can also try discussing the material with a study partner or group, as this can help you learn from each other's perspectives and explanations.
    
5.  **Reflection**: Take time to think about what you have learned and how it fits into your overall knowledge. You can do this by writing a summary of the material, creating a concept map, or discussing it with a study partner.
    
6.  **Feedback**: Seek out feedback on your progress and understanding of the material. This could involve asking a teacher or tutor for feedback, participating in a study group, or asking a friend to quiz you on the material.
    
7. Embrace struggle : Embracing the challenge of learning new material and struggling through it can lead to deeper understanding and better retention.
	As someone that feels as though they have ADHD, for me boredom is the catalyst to learning.
Remember that these strategies are just guidelines, and you may need to experiment to find the ones that work best for you. It's also important to be consistent and dedicated in your study efforts in order to see the best results.
