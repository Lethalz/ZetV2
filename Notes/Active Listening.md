# Active Listening

Active Listening Exercise

Pick a short song for this exercise that uses a full band. You want to start with a short song because you’re going to be repeating the song over and over. Once you build up your active listening skills, you can work on longer songs.

**Playthrough 1:** Play the song and for the entire song, **focus completely on the drums**.

Pay attention to when you hear the snare and bass drum, how the cymbals accent different parts, and the rhythm of any fills.

Keep your attention 100% on the drums and ignore any vocals you hear. Imagine you need to play the drum parts and how your arms and legs would move to match what you hear.

**Playthrough 2:** Play the song and for the entire song, **focus completely on the bass guitar**.

This time, listen carefully to the bass guitar. Pay attention to the tone of the bass, how it sits in the mix behind the guitars, and how it locks in with the drums.

Listen to the riffs and parts and how closely they follow the guitar parts. When you hear the bass play something that doesn’t match the guitar parts, listen to how it fits with the guitar and drums.

Pay attention to how the bass parts match what you hear with the drums. How does the bassist lock-in with the drums and if hear any fills.

**Playthrough 3:** Play the song and for the entire song, **focus completely on the tone of the guitar**.

This time, don’t worry about what the guitar is playing. Instead, focus on how the guitar sounds. Imagine you’re a studio engineer and you had the job of recreating that guitar tone from scratch. Listen to the tone as if your job depended on it.

What effects do you hear and what type of settings do you imagine would be set on the pedals to get that sound? If you have trouble identifying effects, [check out my Guitar Effects Course](https://course.guitargearfinder.com/). It will walk you through every type of effect and give you practice of identifying them.

If different tones are used throughout the song (eg: drive and clean), listen to how the tones work together. Do you hear a volume change when the tone changes? Do the tones sound like they’re completely different guitars or do they work together?

Try to identify any small details such as delay trails, reverb, or anything else that gives the guitar tone character.

**Playthrough 4:** Play the song and for the entire song, **focus completely on the guitar technique**.

This time, listen carefully to what the guitar is playing. If you don’t know how to play the song, imagine what the parts would look like to play. Imagine where you would place your fingers and what techniques you need to use to play the parts.

If you do know how to play the song, listen carefully to how the guitarist is playing every part in detail. Listen for any palm-muting, legato, string noise, bends, etc. Does it sound like the pick is hitting the strings hard or is it played with a lighter touch?

Listen to how the guitar locks in with the drums and bass parts. Where does the guitar match the rhythm of the drums and where does it mix the rhythm up to something different.

**Playthrough 5:** Play the song and for the entire song, **focus completely on the vocals**.

Listen to the melody of the vocals and how the vocalist phrases every line. While you could listen to the words, I recommend ignoring the lyrics and focus on the melody, harmony, and rhythm. Imagine the vocals are an instrument without any words and listen to the musical aspect of it.

Does the vocal melody repeat throughout the song or is every line different? Do you hear repeated ideas throughout the song and do some of those melodies match guitar parts?

Listen to the rhythm of the vocals and how it fits with the other instruments.

Finally, focus on any overdubs and how they fit with the main vocals. If you hear any harmonies, count how many you hear and whether they all follow the same melody or bounce around (called counterpoint).
