How to write good technical documatation?

Outline your topics and structure.

Think of the reading context 
who is the reader
who are you writing to 
what type of language should you use

Only write things down that needs to be there

Use simple langauge

	KISS

Use things other than words
	Use graphs 
	use video
	Flowcharts

The goal of the documentation is for the person to understand your state of mind
