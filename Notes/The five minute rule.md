# The five minute rule

The **"5 minute rule"** is a productivity strategy that suggests tackling any task that takes **less than 5 minutes to complete** as soon as it comes up. The idea is that by quickly taking care of small tasks, you can **prevent them from piling up** and causing stress or distraction later on.

For example, if you receive an email that requires a brief response, the 5 minute rule suggests answering it right away instead of letting it sit in your inbox and potentially causing clutter or anxiety. The “GTD” methodology works here, if you can do it right now, **Do it now!**

By following the 5 minute rule, you can also build momentum and create a sense of accomplishment that can motivate you to tackle larger tasks. However, it's important to balance this approach with your overall priorities and goals, and not get too bogged down in small tasks at the expense of more important ones.
