# Stocks vs Bonds

Companies offer shares of the company when they need to raise capital. 
this is when a company is going from private to public.
However they can raise funds by borrowing or issuing coporate <em>bonds</em>
Bonds are *debt obligations*
And are valued by the interest on the principal loan
Bondholders take priority during bankruptcy
