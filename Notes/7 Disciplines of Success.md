# 7 Disciplines of Success

These tenets are based on the approach of Neuro Linguistic Programming (NLP) and model themselves after a successful person’s beliefs, syntax (language), and physiology.  

What are these disciplines?

1) The first discipline is one of **acting from personal power**. Our ability to take action and to overcome the fear of failure is the most important lesson on the road to success. In fact, there aren’t any failures, only outcomes that eventually lead to a winning result if taken in the right spirit.

2) Next, one should **take charge** and **be totally responsible for one’s world**. As you think, you become and you manifest the outcomes of that thought process through words and action. Think of the solution to the problems and change the things which you don’t like.

3) Being successul requires you to **stretch yourself** – *if you can, you must* go beyond what you’re currently doing. Put yourself on the line when you have to perform and do the things which you falsely believed that you cannot do. Here there are 4 simple steps to follow:

a) Make a commitment to do something beyond your ability.  
b) Make a public declaration (a blog or Facebook page is a good place).  
c) Model someone who is already producing the result.  
d) Follow the model and act as if you do know how to do so even if you don’t.

4) Be committed to **unconscious competence** as opposed to needing to gain complete cognitive understanding. Just as you do not need to know how electricity works to flip the light switch at home, ***focus on being good at what you do as opposed to needing to completely understand how everything works.***

5) Act from a position of **personal integrity**. Being whole or true to yourself, live according to your beliefs and your principles.

6) The meaning of **communication is the response that you get**. In other words, the physiology and tonality of your words and phrases must be changed to ensure that the receiving party understands and appreciates what you want to convey. Intention means nothing. Results mean everything.

7) Finally, be **committed to do whatever it takes to succeed**. Commitment isn’t just a buzz word. It is a way of life that one pursues on a daily basis, walking the talk and scheduling activities that contribute towards that end goal. There is a distinct difference between people who are interested and people who are committed. The former are daydreamers who hope to strike the lottery one day, while the latter work hard to make their personal visions come true
